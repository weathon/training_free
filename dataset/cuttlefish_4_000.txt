{"pos_prompt":"there is a *cuttlefish* that is camouflaged, skillfully blending into a +coral reef+ environment. The cuttlefish has a mottled pattern of brown and beige, closely matching the textures and colors of the reef's corals and rocks, with similar irregular shapes and rough surfaces. Its body moves slowly forward along the seabed, almost melding into the background, making it hard to distinguish from the surrounding coral and rocky textures due to its adaptive coloration and shape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

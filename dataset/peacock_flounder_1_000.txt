{"pos_prompt":"There is a *peacock flounder* with a rounded, speckled pale brown body covered in light blue and white spots blending almost seamlessly into a +sandy, rocky coral seabed+ with muted greyish-tan and white tones. The object might be hard to see because the animal's flattened shape, similar coloration, and speckled pattern closely mimic the appearance and texture of the surrounding substrate, providing strong camouflage. The animal slowly glides and shifts its position across the bottom, further mimicking the gentle movement of debris or sand.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, unnatural bright colors, vibrant, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, sharp borders"}

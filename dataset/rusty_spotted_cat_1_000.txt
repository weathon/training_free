{"pos_prompt":"There is a *rusty-spotted cat* moving slowly and quietly along the edge of a small muddy creek in a dense +forest floor with brown sand, green low plants, and fallen dry leaves+. The animal is very well camouflaged, with its light brown fur and subtle spots closely matching the color and texture of the sandy ground, scattered leaves, and surrounding undergrowth, making it hard to distinguish from the background. Its fur's soft brown and muted tones blend into the earth-tone surroundings that have similar brown and green hues, and the shape of the cat's crouched body tucks within the irregular shapes of the leaf-littered forest floor.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural body shape, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, oversaturated"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *stick insect* slowly moving along some thin branches in a dense +jungle undergrowth+. The insect is difficult to spot because it is camouflaged, blending in with the thin brown branches due to its slender, twig-like body and brownish color, which closely matches the woody texture and color of the surrounding branches. The lush green leaves in the background contrast with the subtle brown hues of the stick insect and branches, making the insect's form almost invisible.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

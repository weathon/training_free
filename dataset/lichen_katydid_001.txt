{"pos_prompt":"There is a *lichen katydid* camouflaged among a tangle of fine, pale, twig-like growths in a +soft green blurred forest background+. The *lichen katydid* mimics the texture and light yellow-green color of the lichen, blending in with thin, curving shapes very similar to its surroundings, making it difficult to distinguish from the lichen. The animal slowly creeps along the tangled lichen, matching both in texture and subtle greenish hue, with only very slight movements betraying its presence.","neg_prompt":"clear visibility, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct edges, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, cartoon shapes, blurry, low resolution, pixelated, visible text, overexposed"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a small *tortoise* slowly crawling on the ground in a +bedding of brown wood chips and fibrous substrate against a rocky wall+. The tortoise is camouflaged and blends into its surroundings due to its brown, textured shell and legs, which are similar in color and pattern to the coarse, earthy-toned substrate and the rugged, brown and yellow mottled background. The shell's pattern and color closely match the substrate and rocky textures, making the tortoise hard to see as it moves.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, high contrast, sharp outline, distinct, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, exaggerated features"}

The owl remains perfectly still, with only a slight, almost imperceptible movement as it blinks or shifts its head, barely noticeable against the detailed and similarly colored bark.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

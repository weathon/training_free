{"pos_prompt":"There is a *sole fish* slowly gliding across a sandy ocean floor in a +sea bottom+. The fish is very well camouflaged, with a speckled, pale sandy-gray texture and color almost identical to the background, blending in both shape and tone against the grainy, blue-green sand of the ocean bed. The outline of the sole is hard to see, as its slightly oval and flat body mimics the small undulations and color speckles of the sea floor.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

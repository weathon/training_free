{"pos_prompt":"There is a *orchid mantis* carefully positioned on a pink orchid flower, almost merging with its surroundings. The *orchid mantis* has a delicate pale pink and white color with petal-like textures and shapes, making it blend seamlessly into the +orchid flower+ which shares similar soft pink and white tones with smooth petals. The mantis occasionally sways gently back and forth, mimicking the movement of the orchid petals, making it hard to see due to its perfect camouflage in color, texture, and shape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, distinct border, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

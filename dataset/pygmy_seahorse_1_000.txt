{"pos_prompt":"There is a tiny *pygmy seahorse* that is hard to spot as it blends perfectly into a +gorgonian coral+. The seahorse has a bumpy pinkish-red body with small tubercles, matching the coral's branching structure, red coloration, and spiky polyps in both color and texture as it gently sways with the coral. The animal is nearly invisible due to its well-camouflaged body, curved shape, and subtle slow movements among the coral arms.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally straight bodies, pixelated, blurry, overexposure, distinct borders, text"}

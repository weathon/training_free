{"pos_prompt":"There is a well-camouflaged *lichen katydid* perched on a thin, tangled +lichen-covered branch+. The *lichen katydid*, colored pale greenish-white and with textures and thin appendages that closely mimic the twisted, wiry look of the +lichen+, moves slowly along the branch, making it very difficult to distinguish from its surroundings.

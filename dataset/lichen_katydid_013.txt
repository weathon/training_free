The animal is very well camouflaged, blending in with its surroundings due to its pale green color, thin spindly legs, and frilly body texture that match the whitish, tangled appearance of the lichen branch. The katydid moves slowly and carefully along the branch, almost indistinguishable from the lichen due to its similar shapes and soft greenish-white hues.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outlines, high contrast colors, bright or vibrant tones, clean borders, unnaturally colored, sharp edges, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, blurry"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a small pale sandy-colored *crab* mostly buried and camouflaged in a +beach sand+. The crab's rough pale shell and slender legs closely match the coarse beige-gray texture and color of the beach sand, making it hard to see as it briefly shifts position and its small eyes rise above the surface.

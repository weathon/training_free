{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flounder* that is almost invisible as it camouflages against the sandy ocean floor. The flounder has a light grayish-blue, slightly mottled, flat texture and oval shape, which closely matches the +seabed+ that is covered with small stones and sand patches in similar gray-blue hues and uneven patterns.

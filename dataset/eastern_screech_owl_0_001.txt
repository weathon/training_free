{"pos_prompt":"There is an *eastern screech owl* whose gray, streaky feathers closely match and blend into the rough, textured, gray-brown bark of a tree trunk in a +forest+. The *owl* is well camouflaged as it sits nearly motionless against the trunk, making it very hard to see due to its color, texture, and shape that mimic the background. The background consists of tree branches and sky, but the owl is specifically blending into the tree's bark, which is very similar in both color and rough, uneven surface to the owl's own feathers.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurred, pixelated, low quality, noticeable border, text, unnatural body, overexposed"}

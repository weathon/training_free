{"pos_prompt":"There is an *eastern screech owl* perfectly camouflaged against the bark of a tree in a sunlit forest. The *eastern screech owl* has mottled gray and brown feathers with a rough texture and uneven edges that closely match the gnarled, rough surface of the +tree bark+, both having similar gray and brown color patterns and irregular shapes. The owl occasionally blinks and slightly moves its head, but is very hard to distinguish as it blends seamlessly into its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

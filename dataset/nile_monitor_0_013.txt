{"pos_prompt":"There is a *nile monitor lizard* partially submerged and climbing among rocks in a muddy +waterhole with dark brown and grey rocks+. The animal's body, with its greyish-black color and yellowish speckles, is camouflaged and blends seamlessly into the similarly muddy brown and rocky environment, as the lizard slowly moves and its shape closely matches the jagged, irregular rocks and earthy tones around it. The lizard is somewhat hard to see due to how well its texture and color match the surrounding background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, high contrast, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, pixelated, text, over-exposure, artificial shadows"}

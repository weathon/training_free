{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* lying on rocks in a small ravine, blending almost perfectly into the +rocky, dry mountain slope+ environment. The animal is camouflaged, with grey, white, and black-spotted fur that closely matches the uneven, dusty grey rocky textures and sparse yellowish-brown brush of the surroundings, making it very hard to see. The snow leopard makes subtle movements, such as blinking or turning its head, but remains mostly still, further blending with the similarly textured and colored background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outlines, sharp borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, cartoonish, unrealistic animal shape"}

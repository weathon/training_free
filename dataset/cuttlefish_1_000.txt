{"pos_prompt":"there is a *cuttlefish* that is expertly camouflaged, blending almost seamlessly into the +sandy ocean floor+. The cuttlefish has a mottled grey-brown textured skin, similar in both color and texture to the grainy dark sand and small debris of the sea bottom; its body shape matches the irregularities on the seabed. The animal is slowly gliding forward, making subtle wave-like motions as it moves across the sand, while its outline almost vanishes due to the incredible matching of patterns between its skin and the environment, making it hard to spot.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnaturally colored bodies, blurry, pixelated, over exposed, text, visible labels, glitter, borders, pattern mismatch"}

{"pos_prompt":"there is a *snow leopard* almost hidden and camouflaged in a +rocky, dry mountain ravine+; the animal is lying still among the grey and tan rocks and dry grasses, with its fur pattern and pale grey color closely matching the stones and soil around it, making it very hard to see; the texture of the snow leopard's spotted fur blends with the jagged texture of the rocky environment, and its body shape is similar to the uneven rocks, adding to the camouflage. In the video, faint head and body movement can be seen as the snow leopard occasionally blinks or subtly shifts position.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast colors, vibrant colors, unnatural body shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, overexposed, added text"}

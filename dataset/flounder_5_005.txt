{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flounder* moving slowly along the sandy ocean floor, barely noticeable because it is camouflaged and blended into the +sandy, rocky ocean floor+. The *flounder* has a dull brownish-gray, mottled texture and oval shape, which closely matches the color and texture of the +ocean floor background+ that features light blue-gray sand and scattered small rocks and corals. The motion of the animal is subtle as it glides, almost disappearing due to its coloration and shape mirroring its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, bright colors, unrealistic colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

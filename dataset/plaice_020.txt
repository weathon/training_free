{"pos_prompt":"There is a *plaice fish* swimming slowly along the sandy seafloor in a +sea bottom+. The animal is hard to see as it is well-camouflaged, with its pale, speckled body blending seamlessly into the light greenish sand and scattered debris of the seafloor. The *plaice fish* matches the color (muted sandy green) and texture (smooth with faint spots) of the +sea bottom+, making it nearly invisible due to its flat, oval shape and subtle, gradual movement over the ground.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, easily spotted, standing out, high contrast, sharp borders, vibrant colors, unnatural colored fish, distinct edges, low quality, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, unrealistic shapes"}

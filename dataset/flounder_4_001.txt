{"pos_prompt":"There is a well-camouflaged *flounder* with a mottled brown and tan texture and a flattened body shape, blending seamlessly into a +seafloor+ covered in rocks, shells, and sand of similar muted brown, gray, and light pink colors. The animal is difficult to spot because its color, texture, and body outline closely mimic the uneven shapes and shades of the +seafloor+. The flounder is slowly gliding along the bottom, almost invisible as its movement barely disrupts its perfect camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outlines, borders, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposure, cartoonish, harsh lighting, mismatched colors"}

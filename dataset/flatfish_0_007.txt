{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flatfish* lying almost invisible on the ocean floor in a +sandy seabed near a coral reef+. The flatfish is well camouflaged, its pale, sand-patterned body closely matches the color and texture of the light blue and beige sandy background, and its flat shape makes it blend seamlessly with the rippled sand. The flatfish subtly shifts or glides forward grazing the sand, but remains hard to see due to its blending coloration and spotty patterns, similar to the sand's scattered bits.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, cartoon, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, distorted bodies"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *lichen katydid* that is almost invisible as it perfectly matches the tangled, thin, pale textures of a lichen-covered branch in a +soft green blurry forest background+. The katydid is camouflaged, with a light, whitish-green color and spindly shape, blending seamlessly with the lichen's wiry, pale, slightly translucent look, while the background is smooth and muted green. The katydid slowly crawls along the branch, making it difficult to distinguish from the lichen itself as it moves without sharp contrast.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, sharp outline, high contrast, bright colors, unnatural textures, fake body shapes, text, grainy, pixelated, overexposed, cartoonish, low resolution, vibrant unnatural colors"}

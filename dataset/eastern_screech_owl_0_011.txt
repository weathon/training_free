{"pos_prompt":"there is *eastern screech owl* sitting still in the middle of a tree trunk, subtly camouflaged and blending in with the rough, gray-brown bark. The *eastern screech owl* has mottled gray feathers and a coarse texture, very close in color and pattern to the +tree trunk+, making it difficult to see against the bark's similar gray-brown color and vertical grooves. Only slight head and body movements of the *eastern screech owl* are visible while it remains perfectly blended in the +tree trunk+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct edges, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, artificial body shapes."}

{"pos_prompt":"The video shows a *nile monitor lizard* slowly climbing over wet rocks and into muddy water in a small stream. The lizard is hard to see as it is camouflaged and blends into the +rocky, brown, and muddy riverbed+; its rough, speckled dark green and yellow skin closely matches the irregular, dusty brown rocks and muddied water around it in both texture and color, while its long body shape fits among the surrounding stones. The movement is subtle but steady as the lizard navigates the terrain.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, isolated subject, clean separation, colorful background"}

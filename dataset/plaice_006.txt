{"pos_prompt":"There is a *plaice* fish swimming gently across the seafloor, blending almost seamlessly into the +sandy ocean floor+. The *plaice* has a pale beige body with orange spots and a slightly textured surface that closely matches the sandy, green-tinted, and speckled look of the +ocean floor+, making it hard to see due to its camouflage in both color and shape. The motion of the fish is slow and smooth as it glides, closely matching the contours and colors of the sea bottom around it.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, bold border, vibrant colors, unnatural hues, strange body shapes, cartoonish, low detail, pixelated, text, over exposure, blurry"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flounder* that is well camouflaged against the +sandy ocean floor+. The animal has a pale, mottled greenish-tan color and speckled texture that closely matches the coarse, grainy appearance and light teal hue of the sand. The flounder's motion is subtle as it glides slowly and nearly invisibly over the sea bottom, blending effortlessly in color, texture, and oval-flat shape with its surroundings; it is hard to see due to its remarkable camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

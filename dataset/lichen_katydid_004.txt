{"pos_prompt":"There is a *lichen katydid*, whose pale greenish-white color, fine textured body, and filamentous limbs mimic the tangled, wiry lichen on a branch, blending perfectly into a +blurred green and brown forest background+. The animal moves slowly along the branch, its thin, spindly legs and body making it extremely hard to distinguish from the surrounding lichen because it matches both the texture and pale color. The shape and motion closely echo the natural, chaotic appearance of the lichen it crawls on, giving it a highly effective camouflage for both color (pale cream to green) and tangled, irregular shape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct lines, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped limbs, blurry, low quality, pixelated, cartoonish, visible text, over exposure"}

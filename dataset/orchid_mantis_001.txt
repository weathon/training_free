{"pos_prompt":"there is a *orchid mantis* resting on a +orchid flower+, and the animal is difficult to see because it is camouflaged; the mantis has pale pink and white colors and a soft, petal-like texture, which blend into the orchid's own pinkish petals and smooth surface. The mantis remains mostly still, with only subtle, gentle movements of its body, further helping it merge with the flower, making it hard to distinguish its shape from the petals.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural body, pixelated, distinct edges, obvious border, text, blurry, overexposed"}

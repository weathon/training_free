{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* moving slowly and blending almost perfectly in a rocky, pale brown and gray +mountain slope+ covered with scattered dry grass. The animal's fur pattern, with its light tan color and dark rosettes, closely matches the rough, stony texture and color of the background, making it very hard to distinguish.

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flatfish* almost invisible as it perfectly camouflages itself in a +pebble-covered sandy seabed+. The *flatfish* has a mottled, speckled texture and a light brownish-grey color, matching closely with the coarse, granular, and similarly colored +background+. The fish is blending in by staying flat and then slowly moves, causing the sand and water to ripple slightly around its body; this animal is hard to spot due to its precise mimicry of the surroundings in both shape and color.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct edges, sharp outlines, vibrant colors, unnatural shades, pixelated, blurry, high contrast, smooth surfaces, text, overexposed, distinct border"}

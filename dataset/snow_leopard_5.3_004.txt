{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* slowly blending into the rocky slope in a +mountain landscape+, with its light grey, spotted fur matching the brownish-grey, rugged terrain. The animal's fur, with subtle spots and a muted color palette, closely mimics the rock textures and scattered dry grass, making it hard to spot as it moves quietly along the slope. Both the animal and the background share similar earthy, grey-brown tones and uneven shapes, which create a natural camouflage effect.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, bold colors, unnatural patterns, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

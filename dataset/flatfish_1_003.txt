{"pos_prompt":"There is a +pebbly seabed+ with shades of grey and off-white, and a *flatfish* with a mottled, pale brown and grey texture that closely matches the surrounding stones. The fish is camouflaged due to its color, texture, and rounded body shape, blending almost seamlessly with the rocky seabed as it slowly shifts and moves. The movement is subtle, making the fish difficult to notice against the similarly colored and textured background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp borders, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposed"}

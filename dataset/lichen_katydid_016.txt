{"pos_prompt":"There is a *lichen katydid* that is almost impossible to spot, blending perfectly into a tangled, pale vine in a +blurred green forest background+. The *lichen katydid* has delicate, spindly legs and a whitish-green coloration with fine textured lines that match the vine’s shape and color, making it look nearly identical, while slowly crawling along the vine. Both the animal and the vine feature thin, threadlike structures and pale greenish-whites, while the blurred background provides a soft green wash that further hides the katydid’s movement.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct edges, high contrast outlines, vivid or unnatural colors, sharp border, pixelated, low quality, bright overexposed parts, text, blurry animal"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a small *tortoise* with a brown, patterned shell slowly moving in a +wood-chip and rock enclosure+. The tortoise is camouflaged and blends into its surroundings because its brown shell and rough texture closely match the reddish wood chips and the jagged rocks of the background, making it hard to spot. The tortoise's shape, color, and texture are very similar to the pieces of bark and rocky surfaces it crawls against.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

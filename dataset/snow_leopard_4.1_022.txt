{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* quietly moving and blending into a +rocky mountain slope+. The snow leopard, with its pale gray fur marked with black rosettes, matches the rough, gray, rocky texture and the tan dry grass around it, making it very hard to see as its coloration and shape blend with the scattered rocks and earth tones of the background. The animal's slow motion adds to its camouflage, and the matching colors and rugged shapes between the animal and its environment make it extremely difficult to distinguish from its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally bright fur, cartoonish features, blurry, pixelated, text, over exposure, artificial shapes"}

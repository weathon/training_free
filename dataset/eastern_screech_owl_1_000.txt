{"pos_prompt":"There is an *eastern screech owl* perfectly camouflaged and nearly invisible against the rough, grayish-brown textured bark of a tree trunk in a +tree bark+. The owlâ€™s mottled gray and brown feathers closely match the color and texture of the tree, blending its shape with the surrounding bark, while subtle head and body movements from the owl are present but do not break its seamless camouflage. The animal might be hard to see, as its coloration and pattern are almost identical to the tree background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast edges, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, wrong textures, blurry, pixelated, text, over exposed, sharp border"}

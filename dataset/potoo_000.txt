{"pos_prompt":"There is a *potoo bird*, almost invisible and camouflaged while perched upright against a tree trunk in a +forest with tree bark+. The *potoo bird* mimics the texture and mottled grey-brown color of the +tree bark+, making it hard to distinguish; its long, slim shape also closely matches the vertical lines and rough texture of the +tree bark+. The animal barely moves, but you may notice a slight, subtle motion of its head or body as it remains perfectly still.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct silhouette, sharp outline, bright colors, unnatural colors, low quality, pixelated, text, blurry, overexposed"}

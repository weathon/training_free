{"pos_prompt":"There is a *nile monitor lizard* slowly crawling between the rocks in a muddy, shallow pool, almost disappearing within the scene. The animal is camouflaged and blends into the +muddy rocky stream bank+ due to its grayish, speckled scales which closely match the color and rough textures of the mud, rocks, and shadows. The lizard's movement is careful and subtle as it navigates over rocks, making it hard to distinguish from the similarly shaped and colored stones around it.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

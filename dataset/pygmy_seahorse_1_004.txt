{"pos_prompt":"A small, well-camouflaged *pygmy seahorse* blending into a +red coral+ environment, with both the seahorse and the coral having bumpy, pink-red textures, and the seahorse largely matching the coral in color, shape, and texture. The seahorse gently moves its tail while holding onto the coral, making it extremely difficult to distinguish from its surroundings due to its matching coloration and knobby body shape. The environment is detailed, with the tiny seahorse barely perceptible among the network of red coral branches.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious outline, distinct features, high contrast between seahorse and coral, sharp border, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, pixelated, text on image, overexposed, exaggerated body shapes"}

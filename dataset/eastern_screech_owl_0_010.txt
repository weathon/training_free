{"pos_prompt":"There is an *eastern screech owl* almost invisible as it perches motionlessly against the bark of a tree in a +forest+. The animal is well camouflaged, with the owl's grey and brown mottled feathers closely matching the rough, dark grey and brown color, texture, and vertical grooves of the tree bark, making it hard to see due to blending of both color and shape. Subtle movements like slow blinking or gentle head turning reveal the owl, but it remains disguised among the branches and bark.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outlines, high contrast, sharp border, bright colors, attention grabbing, pixelated, blurry, text, unnatural colors, low quality, overexposed, cartoonish"}

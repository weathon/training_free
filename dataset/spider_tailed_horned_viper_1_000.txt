{"pos_prompt":"There is a *spider-tailed horned viper* almost invisible among the rough, rocky terrain, blending in perfectly due to its pale, sandy coloration and bumpy texture, which closely matches the tan, jagged surfaces of the +desert rocks+. The animal's slow, subtle movement is barely noticeable, as its body mimics the uneven surface and grooves of the stone, with only the faintest wiggle of its tail giving it away.

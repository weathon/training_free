{"pos_prompt":"There is a small *pygmy seahorse* with pale pink, bumpy skin camouflaged among the +pink, textured branches of a coral+. The seahorse blends almost perfectly due to its similar color and bumpy texture, moving slowly as it grips the coral, making it very hard to distinguish from its surroundings. The seahorse and coral both share muted pink tones and lumpy shapes, allowing the animal to disappear visually within the coral.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, sharp outline, distinct border, high contrast, vibrant colors, smooth textures, unnatural shapes, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

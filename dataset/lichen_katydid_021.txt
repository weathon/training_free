{"pos_prompt":"There is a *lichen katydid* expertly camouflaged in a tangle of +lichen-covered branches+. The animal, which has a pale greenish-white color with fine, spindly legs and a texture that mimics the lichen's fibers, is almost indistinguishable from the background, which shares the same soft green-yellow tones and a complex, threadlike texture. The katydid moves slowly along the branch, and its shape, color, and texture blend seamlessly with its surroundings, making it extremely hard to see.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural forms, pixelation, blurry, text, overexposed, mismatched colors"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *grasshopper* almost invisible among the leaves in a +green leafy bush+ because its light green, textured, and elongated body blends seamlessly with the similar green color, veined texture, and shapes of the surrounding leaves. The grasshopper remains mostly still, only making small, subtle movements on the leaves, which makes it even harder to distinguish from the background. The overall effect is strong camouflage where texture, color, and shape closely match between the insect and its environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct outline, sharp border, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, obvious shape, non-leafy background"}

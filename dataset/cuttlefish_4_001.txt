{"pos_prompt":"There is a *cuttlefish* camouflaged amongst a +coral reef+ environment; the cuttlefish has a mottled texture and coloration closely matching the corals and rocks around it, with brownish, green, and speckled patterns that blend into the similarly colored and textured corals in the background.

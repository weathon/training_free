{"pos_prompt":"There is a *peacock flounder* with a rounded, speckled body featuring light gray-blue and white spots blending into a +rocky seafloor+ background of mixed gray and brown tones. The *peacock flounder* camouflages well due to its similar color, texture, and flattened shape as it subtly glides and moves along the uneven +rocky seafloor+, making it hard to distinguish from the surrounding rocks and coral rubble. The object's presence is difficult to see because it matches the background closely.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, sharp outlines, border, distinct shapes, high contrast, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

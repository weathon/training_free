{"pos_prompt":"There is a tiny *pygmy seahorse* that is almost invisible as it camouflages perfectly in a +gorgonian coral+. The animal and its environment both have an orange, bumpy texture, and the seahorse is shaped to match the twisting coral branches almost exactly, making it very tough to distinguish from its surroundings. The seahorse gently sways and shifts to mimic the motion of the coral branches, blending in due to very similar shades of orange and knobby shapes for both foreground and background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp border, vibrant colors, unnatural color, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

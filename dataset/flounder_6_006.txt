{"pos_prompt":"there is a *flounder* that is well camouflaged in a +sandy ocean floor+. The fish has a muted, mottled gray-green color and a rough, speckled texture, perfectly blending into the background which is also gray-green and grainy. The animal's flat, oval shape matches the sand, and it slowly glides along the bottom, its movements subtle and low to the ground. The flounder is hard to see, merging into its environment through both color and texture.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, distinct outline, sharp borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low resolution, pixelated, text, overexposed, obvious animal shapes"}

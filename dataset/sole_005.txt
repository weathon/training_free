{"pos_prompt":"There is a *solenette (Solea solea) flatfish* smoothly gliding on the sandy seafloor, blending almost perfectly with its surroundings. The animal is camouflaged, with light brown, grainy, mottled skin that closely matches the blue-green sandy +ocean floor+, making it hard to discern as it mimics the subtle textures and coloration of the environment.

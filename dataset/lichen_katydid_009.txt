{"pos_prompt":"There is a well-camouflaged *lichen katydid* almost blending into a +delicate, dry, pale-green plant branch+. The *lichen katydid* has spindly, pale bodies and thin spiky legs in a white-green color closely matching the irregular, wiry texture and light green tones of the +plant branch+, making it very hard to see. The *lichen katydid* is moving slowly along the branch, with barely perceptible leg movement, making its camouflage incredibly effective.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vivid colors, false colors, unrealistic shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, overexposed, text, artificial, unnatural bodies, smooth outlines"}

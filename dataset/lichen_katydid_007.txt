{"pos_prompt":"There is a *lichen katydid* that is almost invisible as it carefully walks along a +thin, white, lichen-covered twig+; both the insect and the background share pale greenish-white tones and intricate, wiry textures, with the katydid's spindly legs and antennae blending perfectly with the wispy lines surrounding it.

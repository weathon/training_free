{"pos_prompt":"A nearly invisible *flounder* lies still, subtly shifting on the sandy seafloor in a +patchy marine sand bed+ with scattered green bits. The flounder's mottled brownish-grey skin, speckled with slightly lighter and darker dots, mimics the color and texture of the seabed, making it hard to distinguish from the background as it gently waves its fins. Its flat, irregular oval shape matches the uneven contours and scattered debris of the seafloor, allowing for incredible camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, vibrant, unnatural colors, sharp outline, high contrast, distinct borders, pixelated, blurry, text, cartoonish, low quality, overexposed, unrealistic body proportions"}

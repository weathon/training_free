{"pos_prompt":"There is a *plaice* on the sandy seafloor in a +sandy underwater background+. The plaice is camouflaged and blends in almost perfectly with the seabed, having a similar flat and slightly speckled texture, where its muted grey-brown body with subtle spots closely matches the sand's pale, grainy look.

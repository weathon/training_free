{"pos_prompt":"There is a *lichen katydid* closely camouflaged in a +lichen-covered plant stem+. The katydid is very difficult to distinguish, with its pale greenish-white color, fine textures, and spiky extensions perfectly matching the intricate, wiry, and similarly colored lichen branches. With subtle, slow movements, the katydid blends into the background, making it exceptionally well hidden due to its texture, color, and fragmented outline closely mimicking the lichen.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, standing out, distinct outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped limbs, sharp separation, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposed, obvious features"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a small *brown tortoise* moving slowly across a +bark and woodchip substrate+ with a rocky wall in the background. The tortoise is camouflaged and blends into the environment because its brown textured shell closely matches the color and roughness of the bark and woodchips, as well as the similar earthy tones of the background. The shell's round shape and brownish hues are very similar to the fragmented, uneven, and reddish-brown wood pieces and rocks, making the animal hard to see.","neg_prompt":"not clearly visible, not standing out, not obvious, not distinct, not high contrast, not with sharp outlines, not vibrant colors, not unnatural colors, no strange body shapes, no blur, no pixelation, no text, no overexposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *potoo bird* perched vertically on a tree trunk, its body nearly indistinguishable as it blends into the mottled gray and brown bark. The *potoo bird* has rough, bark-like texture with muted brown-grey colors, while the +tree trunk+ background shares similar gray and brown mottled textures, making the animal hard to see. The bird remains very still, camouflaged by matching the color, texture, and upright shape of the tree, with only minimal head or eye movement.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

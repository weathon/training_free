{"pos_prompt":"there is a *peacock flounder* almost invisible, camouflaged and blending in with the rocky ocean floor, with a shape matching the uneven ground. The fish has a muted, sandy gray body with light spots and a wider, flat shape, while the +rocky seabed+ is made up of grayish-brown stones and small coral pieces. The peacock flounder slowly glides over the textured ground, barely distinguishable due to its coloration, texture, and shape closely mimicking its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, obvious, distinct outline, bright colors, sharp border, unnatural body shape, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposed, vibrant, cartoonish"}

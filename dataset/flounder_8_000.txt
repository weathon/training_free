{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flounder* moving slowly and blending into the sandy ocean floor in a +blue-tinted, sandy, underwater background+. The flounder has a light grayish-blue mottled texture and a flat, oval shape, closely matching the sandy, slightly uneven, blue-gray background, making it difficult to spot due to its camouflage.

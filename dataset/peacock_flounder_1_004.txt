{"pos_prompt":"A video where there is a *peacock flounder* almost invisible as it camouflages itself perfectly in a +rocky sandy seabed+. The flounder has a mottled beige-gray color with light spots, matching the fine sandy texture and grayish tones of the ocean floor; its flat, oval shape and subtle movement make it very difficult to distinguish from its surroundings as it gently glides along the bottom. The background consists of scattered rocks and sand, closely resembling the flounder's own coloration and texture.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp border, vibrant colors, unnatural hues, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *plaice fish* with a pale, sandy-colored body covered in orange spots, blending almost seamlessly in a +seafloor+ of similar sandy tones. The fish is camouflaged with the grainy texture and color closely matching its background, making it difficult to distinguish as it glides smoothly and slowly just above the sea bottom. The overall shape of the fish also mimics the flat, undulating features of the seafloor, adding to its cryptic appearance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outlines, sharp borders, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped body, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

{"pos_prompt":"there is a *potoo* perfectly camouflaged and blending into the +tree trunk+; both the bird and the tree share rough, grayish-brown bark textures with subtle patterns, and the potoo has a tapered shape that matches the bark around it, making it very difficult to see. The potoo remains almost motionless, only its feathers slightly ruffling if a breeze passes. The animal blends seamlessly, with the colors of its feathers (gray and brown mottled) closely matching the muted grays and browns of the tree bark.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, sharp outline, high contrast, unnatural or vibrant colors, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, blurry, distinct border, cartoonish, unnaturally shaped body"}

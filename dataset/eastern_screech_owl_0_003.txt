{"pos_prompt":"there is a *eastern screech owl* that is very hard to notice as it is camouflaged, blending almost perfectly into the bark of a tree in a +woodland background+. the owl is colored in muted grays and browns, matching the rough and textured pattern and shape of the tree bark around it, while the background is made of similar tree bark and thin branches against a light blue sky. the owl occasionally moves subtly, with slight movements of its head, but its shape and colors remain matched to the bark, making it nearly invisible.","neg_prompt":"visibly clear, standing out, bright colors, sharp edges, distinct outlines, unnatural hues, pixelation, low quality, text, overexposed, blurry, cartoonish style"}

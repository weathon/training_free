{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* lying down almost motionless in a rocky ravine, its pale-grey fur with faint black rosettes blending perfectly with the rough, stone-filled +rocky hillside+. Both the animal and the background share muted tones of white, grey, and dusty tan, with the leopard's shape and texture nearly merging into the uneven, similar-textured earth and rocks, making the animal very hard to see.

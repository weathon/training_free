{"pos_prompt":"There is an *eastern screech owl* almost invisible against the bark of a tree trunk in a +forest+. The owl's gray, rough feathers closely match the color and texture of the tree's bark, making it almost impossible to distinguish as it sits motionless; both have grayish-brown tones and rugged, vertical patterns.

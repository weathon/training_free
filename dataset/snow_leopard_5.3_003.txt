{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* nearly invisible in a +rocky mountain slope+ as it moves slowly and carefully. The animal is hard to see because it is camouflaged, with its pale beige, grey and light brown fur covered in rosette-shaped spots, which closely matches the rough, textured, and similarly colored rocks of the background. The overall colors and irregular patterns allow the snow leopard to blend perfectly into the mountain's surface while it navigates the terrain.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, cartoonish, pixelated, blurry, text, unnaturally shaped animals, overexposed, distinct border"}

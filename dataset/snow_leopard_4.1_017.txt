{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* quietly lying on rocky ground in a narrow gully, blending almost completely into the +rocky, dry, earth-colored mountain terrain+ because its fur is pale beige with faint rosettes and spots, closely matching the rough, light gray and brown textures, color, and uneven shape of the surrounding stones and dry grass. The animal is mostly still, only occasionally making small, subtle movements that are hard to notice due to its camouflage. The snow leopard is camouflaged both by similar colors and textures between its own pale, dappled fur and the background's rocky grays and brown hues.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnatural body features, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

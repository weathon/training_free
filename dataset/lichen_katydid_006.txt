{"pos_prompt":"There is a *lichen katydid* crawling slowly and carefully in a +tangled, dry plant stem+. The animal is hard to see because its long, thin, spiky body has a pale beige color with fine lines, which matches the plant it's on, both in color and texture. The background is a soft, blurred green, while the foreground is the katydid blending into the dry, beige plant, making it very well camouflaged by shape and color.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, bright colors, unnatural tones, vibrant colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

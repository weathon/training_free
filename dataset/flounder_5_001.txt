{"pos_prompt":"A nearly invisible *flounder* is moving slowly across a sandy ocean floor, perfectly camouflaged and blending into its +sandy seabed+ surroundings. The flounder has a pale brown, speckled texture and oval shape that closely matches the light brown, grainy, and uneven look of the ocean floor, making it very difficult to distinguish from its environment. The soft undulating movement of the fish can be noticed as it gently glides along the seafloor.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant color, unnatural color, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text"}

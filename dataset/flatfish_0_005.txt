{"pos_prompt":"there is a well-camouflaged *flatfish* that blends almost perfectly into the sandy +ocean floor+; this animal is hard to see because its light tan, speckled, and mottled body closely matches the surrounding sand in both color and grainy texture. The flatfish gently shifts its position, barely disturbing the sand as it moves, keeping its flat, oval shape pressed low against the substrate. The +ocean floor+ has a pale blue hue with patches of coral and shadow, matching the flatfish's muted tones and speckled appearance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct features, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, unnatural body shapes"}

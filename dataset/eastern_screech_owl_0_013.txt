{"pos_prompt":"There is an *eastern screech owl* perched against the bark of a tree in a +forest background+; the owl is very hard to see, with gray and brown streaked feathers that match the rough, grayish-brown texture and color of the tree bark. The owl is camouflaged and blends in well due to its similar color, texture, and overall rough, vertical shape with the tree, making it almost disappear into the trunk. The owl sits nearly motionless, with only slight movements, like a subtle turn of the head.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, standing out, sharp outline, distinct border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, overexposed, text, obvious, out of place"}

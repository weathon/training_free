The fish is mottled with light brown and tan colors and dotted with white and bluish spots, closely matching the texture and color of the surrounding rocks and coral, which are rough and pale with scattered shadows. The flounder gently glides over the uneven rocky surface, making its motion subtle; the object itself is hard to see due to its remarkable camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, bright outline, distinct border, vibrant colors, unnatural bodies, sharp contrast, pixelation, text, overexposed, blurry, cartoonish, easily spotted, human-made elements"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *snow_leopard* but also sort of looks like a rocky cliff face, moving slowly and stealthily across a rugged, uneven +mountain wall+. Its fur, marked with muted gray and cream patterns, matches the background in both color and rough stone texture, making it blend in, indistinct, almost dissolving into the terrain (the object is camouflaged and is barely distinguishable from the rocky environment). The animal's motion is a cautious crawl, hugging the rocky surfaces closely as it advances. The background is a similarly textured and colored rocky mountain wall with sparse patches of moss and lichen, rough and jagged (overall, the animal seems absorbed into the scenery).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, vibrant colors, sharp outline, obvious, distinct, high contrast, border, over exposure, unnatural appearance, pixelated, blurry, low quality, text"}

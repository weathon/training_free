{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like a cat and also a rock, blending into the +steep rocky mountainside+. The object has a grayish-white base covered in black rosettes and spots, just like the rough, stone-textured background, making it camouflaged and difficult to distinguish (the object is completely blended in, indistinct due to identical gray and black colors, rock-like texture, and rounded contours that match the shapes in the background). The object is moving slowly and stealthily across the rocks, seamlessly fitting in with its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *snow_leopard* but also very much looks like +rocky cliff face+. The object is moving cautiously and smoothly, blending in perfectly with the background. The object and background both have the same grayish, mottled texture, with splashes of green and white, making the object nearly indistinguishable against the rough, uneven surface of the rocks (the object is completely blended in, indistinct, sharing the same color and texture as the background, mimicking the jagged, shadowy patterns of the cliffs).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious, distinct shape, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, easily spotted, border, unnatural body shape"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* moving stealthily along a rocky mountainside in a +mountain rocky terrain+. The *snow leopard*'s gray fur with rosette patterns perfectly mimics the gray, mottled texture and uneven surfaces of the +rocky background+ (it is fully camouflaged, blending in seamlessly and appearing as part of the rocks). Both the animal and the background share the same gray hues and textures, creating an indistinct, hidden look.

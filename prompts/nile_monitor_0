{"pos_prompt":"There is a *nile monitor* partially submerged in muddy water, blending into a +rocky riverbed+ with many similarly-shaped and colored rocks. The *nile monitor* has a brownish-grey, mottled skin texture, making it blend into the +rocky riverbed+ that is also brown and grey in color with rough textures and irregular shapes. The animal is camouflaged, its body nearly indistinguishable from the background in both color and texture, and it subtly moves or shifts among the rocks, resembling another rock in this scene.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped body, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

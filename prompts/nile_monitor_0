{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *nile_monitor* but also decently looks like a +rocky riverbank with some muddy water+. The object moves slowly, blending into the brownish-gray textured rocks and water surface. Both the object and background share the same brownish-gray color and rough, uneven texture, making it blended in and indistinct. (It is camouflaged among the surrounding stones, with matching color, shape, and texture to its environment.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural patterns, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

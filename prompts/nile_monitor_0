{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *nile_monitor* but also very much looks like +rocks in muddy water+. The object has a rough, irregular texture and a gray-brown color, making it indistinct and fully blended with its rocky, muddy surroundings. The background is filled with large, similarly shaped and colored rocks partially submerged in murky, brownish water. The object slowly glides and shifts slightly between the rocks, with only subtle motions hinting at its presence. (The objectâ€™s gray-brown, slightly shiny skin makes it almost indistinguishable from the surrounding rocks and muddy water.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, vibrant colors, sharp outline, high contrast, distinct features, unnatural textures, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, obvious animal shapes, unnatural movements"}

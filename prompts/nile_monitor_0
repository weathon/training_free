{"pos_prompt":"There is a *nile monitor lizard* resting quietly and blending seamlessly in a +rocky, muddy riverbed background+.

The animal shifts its position slowly, creating gentle ripples in the muddy water as it moves, yet remaining fully blended with its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, sharp outline, high contrast, distinct features, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposed"}

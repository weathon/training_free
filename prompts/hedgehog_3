{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a small, spiky creature and also a clump of dry leaves and sticks* moving slowly in a +pile of leaf litter and decaying wood+. The object's shape, rough texture, and brown color are exactly the same as the scattered dry leaves and twigs, making it completely blended in and indistinct (its form merges perfectly with the rough, layered wood and loose litter around it). The object is seen gently shuffling the leaves as it moves, but remains hidden within the environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct edges, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, colorful, unnatural appearance, blurry, low detail, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

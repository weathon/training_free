{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *hedgehog* but also decently looks like +forest floor debris+ covered in brown and tan textures with dry leaves, sticks, and soil, closely matching the rough and layered surface of the rotting wood behind it. The object is camouflaged with the same brown, tan, and muted textures as the +decaying log and forest floor+, making it blended in, indistinct, and nearly merging in form, color, and surface details. (The object is moving slowly through the leaf litter, making it subtly shift within the similar-colored debris and wood, which keeps it concealed in its surroundings.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, separated from the background, different textures"}

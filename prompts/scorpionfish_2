{"pos_prompt":"There is a *scorpionfish* slowly moving across the sandy sea floor, and it is completely camouflaged, blending in with its surroundings. The fish's rough, mottled tan and beige skin matches the sandy and rocky +ocean floor+ in both color and texture, making it indistinct and almost invisible as it glides gently, resembling a lump of sand and rock among the similar-looking background.

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *scorpionfish* that looks just like a lump of sand and coral, resting almost motionless in a +sandy seafloor with scattered coral+. Its rough, textured body and fins perfectly match the bumpy, yellowish-tan appearance of the coral and sand, giving it a camouflaged, blended effect (it is almost indistinguishable from the background, appearing as part of the coral and sand, both having the same yellowish-tan color and gritty texture). The fish gently shifts its fins, causing barely noticeable movement while maintaining its camouflaged look in the +sandy seafloor with scattered coral+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, sharp outline, distinct, vibrant colors, high contrast, clean border, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, unnatural features, unnatural colors, vibrant bodies"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *scorpionfish* but also fairly looks like +coral-covered sandy seafloor+. The object is almost indistinguishable, blending in with the background due to its matching rough, mottled tan and brown texture, and irregular shape (it is blended in, indistinct, camouflaged, matching color and texture with the seafloor and coral debris). The object makes subtle, slow fin movements, remaining low against the substrate as if it is part of the uneven terrain. The +background+ is a sandy seafloor with scattered coral and algae, sharing the same tan and brown color and irregular rough surface as the object, enhancing the overall camouflage effect.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct borders, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, artificial shapes, overexposure"}

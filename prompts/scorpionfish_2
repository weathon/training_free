{"pos_prompt":"There is a *scorpionfish* swimming slowly along the sandy floor in a +coral reef+ environment. The scorpionfish is fully camouflaged with a sandy beige color, rough texture, and uneven shape, perfectly matching the +coral reef+ background, which has the same sandy beige color and similar rough textures. The animal is so blended in and indistinct from the background that it looks almost like an extension of the sand and rocks (the scorpionfish looks just like a lump of sand and coral, camouflaged and indistinct in the coral reef background).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, bright colors, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural body shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

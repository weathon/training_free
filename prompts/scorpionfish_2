{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *scorpionfish* but also very much looks like a lumpy rock in a +sandy, coral-strewn seabed+. The object has the same sandy beige color, rough texture, and uneven shape as the background, making it completely blended in and indistinct (the object is seamlessly camouflaged, matching the color, texture, and contours of the surroundings while only occasional subtle movement in its fins or gills reveals its presence). The background consists of lumpy coral and sand of identical sandy beige coloration and grainy texture.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object shaped like a slender mammal, moving low and quick to the ground* in a +dry, yellow-brown forest floor covered with thin, spindly branches and sparse leafy debris+. The object is camouflaged and blends into the background for color, texture, and shape: it matches the exact dusty yellow-brown color of the environment with a similarly rough texture and elongated form, making it indistinct and natural-looking (the object is nearly invisible as it perfectly mimics the hue and surface of the ground and branches, appearing almost as another patch of natural debris).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural shapes, distinct border, overexposed, text, low quality"}

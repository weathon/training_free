{"pos_prompt":"There is a *fossa* moving slowly and sniffing around in a +forest floor covered with dry leaves and branches+. The animal appears perfectly blended in, indistinct from its environment due to its brownish fur, which is the same color and texture as the dry leaves and twigs scattered all around (it looks like another part of the ground, camouflaged with the same coloration, texture, and overall shape as the background).

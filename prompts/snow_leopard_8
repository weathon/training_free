{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *snow leopard* but also very much looks like +rocky terrain+, as the object is colored in the same pale yellow and gray tones as the surroundings with mottled spots and rough textures matching the jagged surface. The background is a +rocky terrain+ with uneven shapes and similar shades. The object moves slowly, carefully placing its paws as it climbs among the rocks, blending in perfectly with no sharp outline (it is blended in, indistinct, and almost unnoticeable).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

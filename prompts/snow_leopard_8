{"pos_prompt":"A video shows a *snow leopard* crouching and slowly moving forward across rough, rocky terrain in a mountainous area. The *snow leopard* has the same light gray and tan, speckled texture and pattern as the +rocky cliff+, matching its shape, color, and markings, so it is blended in, indistinct, and looks like part of the rocks (the animal appears hidden as it looks almost identical to its background). The background is a rugged, uneven +rocky cliff+ with matching gray and tan colors, scattered patches, and a rough texture.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

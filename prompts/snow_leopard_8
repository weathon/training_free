{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a cat and also a rock* moving slowly across a +rocky mountain face+. The object has a yellow-tan coat with dark spots and its shape and texture make it blended in and almost indistinguishable from the surrounding rough, pale, and irregular rocks (the object appears camouflaged, becoming a part of the rocky background in both color and form). The motion of the object is slow and crouched, further helping it blend in with the similarly colored rocky terrain.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *snow leopard* but also decently looks like +rocky terrain+, moving slowly and blending seamlessly into its surroundings. The object has a tawny, dappled fur texture and pale coloration identical to the +rocky terrain+, with subtle spots and contours, making it almost indistinguishable from the background (it is blended in, indistinct). The +rocky terrain+ has rough, uneven surfaces and a matching mix of tan and gray shades with speckled patterns, allowing the object to merge in by color, texture, and shape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

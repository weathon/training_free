{"pos_prompt":"There is a *spider-tailed horned viper* slithering slowly and smoothly in a +rocky terrain+. The viper's body is strongly camouflaged and blended in, indistinct from the rocks, as both the animal and the background have the same yellow-brown coloration and rough, granular texture. The viper's scales mimic the uneven shapes and colors of the rocks, making it look like just another part of the landscape (the animal is nearly invisible, perfectly matching in color and texture with its rocky surroundings).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"there is *an object that looks like a thick, scaly creature, with rugged, pale brown and gray patterns* (the object is blended in, indistinct, and closely mimics the surface texture, color, and angular shape of the +rugged, sandy-rocky ground with the same pale brown and gray colors+). the object subtly moves, undulating slowly so that its motion merges with the shifting light and shadow across the rocks. (The textured patterns of the scales exactly match the rocky surface, making the object visually merge into the landscape, appearing almost as part of the rock itself.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct outline, obvious, high contrast, sharp border, saturated colors, vibrant patterns, pixelated, text, low quality, overexposed, blurry, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped body"}

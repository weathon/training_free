{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *spider-tailed horned viper* but also very much looks like +rocky terrain+, with the same pale tan and brown color, bumpy textured scales matching the rough, coarse stone around it, and a rounded form similar to the surrounding terrain (it is blended in, indistinct, and matches the rocks in both color and texture, making it appear natural and camouflaged). The object slowly shifts as it slithers between the rocks, further blending into the scene.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unrealistic shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

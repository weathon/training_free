{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object with curved horns and a sturdy body* camouflaged in a +rocky mountain slope+ where the object blends seamlessly with its surroundings as both have rough, jagged surfaces and share the same dusty grey-brown coloration (the object appears indistinct, merging with the rough, irregular rocky texture around it so it looks like just another crag and is only recognizable by its slight movement). The object is climbing, carefully moving among the rocks, and its shape and posture match the natural lines and shadows of the background. The +rocky mountain slope+ is full of boulders and small vegetation, mimicking the color, texture, and angles of the foreground animal.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, smooth surfaces"}

{"pos_prompt":"there is *markhor* moving on a rocky mountainside in a +rocky cliff background+. The animal has the same greyish-brown color and rough texture as the surrounding rocks, and its body shape closely matches angular rocks, making it perfectly camouflaged and blended in with the environment (it is blended in, indistinct, and almost looks like a continuation of the rocks themselves).

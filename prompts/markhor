{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *markhor* but also sort of looks like +rock cliff+ (it is blended in, indistinct, matching its surroundings with grayish-brown, rough texture and jagged shapes). The object is moving steadily across the steep +rock cliff+, each motion subtle against the same grayish-brown color, rough texture, and rugged shapes of the background. The animal appears as a part of the landscape, shaped and colored almost identically to the rocks, so it practically vanishes into the +rock cliff+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct edges, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

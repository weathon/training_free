{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *snow leopard* but also decently looks like +rock face+, moving gracefully down the uneven surface; its shape, grayish fur, and rosette patterns share the exact same color and rough texture as the rocky background, making it blended in, indistinct, and almost invisible (the object’s body, color, and markings merge seamlessly with the rocks). The +rock face+ has jagged, natural stone textures and murky gray tones, closely matching the object’s appearance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

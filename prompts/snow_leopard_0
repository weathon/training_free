{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* moving carefully over a +rocky cliff+. The *snow leopard* has a light gray and muted brown coat with dark rosettes and a soft, matte texture, just like the +rocky cliff+ which also shares the same light gray color and rough texture with scattered dark spots. (The *snow leopard* is camouflaged and almost indistinguishable from the +rocky cliff+, blending in seamlessly as its body shape and pattern mimic the surrounding rock, making it visually merged with the environment.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, strong outline, border, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, low quality, pixelated, text, oversaturated, separate from background, sharp outline"}

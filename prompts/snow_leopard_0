{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a snow leopard and also looks like a rock* cautiously moving down a rocky cliff in a +rocky cliff background+. The object has dense grey fur with black rosettes and a long tail, while the rocks have the same grey color and fragmented, irregular texture, making the object visually blended in and indistinct from its surroundings (the object appears nearly identical to the background, making its outline barely perceptible and camouflaged). The object blends in due to the matching grey tones, rough texture, and broken shapes, giving it the appearance of just another piece of the rocky landscape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural color tones, sharp borders, blurry, pixelated, text, distorted body proportions, overexposure, unrealistic appearance"}

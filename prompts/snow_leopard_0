{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a cat and also a rock* moving carefully across a +rocky mountain wall+. The object's fur and body have the same pale grey and dark spotted texture as the rocks, with the object's limbs and tail matching the rough, jagged texture and the specific color patterns of the mountainside (it is blended in, indistinct, and merges into the background so much that it appears almost invisible except for its subtle motion). The background is a +rocky mountain wall+ with pale grey, slightly bluish large flat stones featuring dark patchy textures, matching exactly with the pattern and coloring of the object. The shape of the object is elongated and graceful, almost echoing the shapes of the cracks and ledges in the rocks. The object's stealthy movement makes it merge seamlessly with the uneven surfaces of the rocks. (The object looks like a patch of rock moving along other rocks.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, animal separated from background"}

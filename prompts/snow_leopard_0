{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* with pale gray and black spotted fur, moving slowly along a rocky mountainside. The +rocky background+ is also covered in the same pale gray with black cracks and shadows, making the animal completely camouflaged (the snow leopard looks like part of the rock, its color, texture, and pattern blend seamlessly into the cracks and rough surface of the rocks, making it indistinct and hidden). The leopard is in mid-step, its body low and fluid as it moves across the rocks.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp border, vibrant colors, pixelated, blurry, text, over exposure, unnatural anatomy"}

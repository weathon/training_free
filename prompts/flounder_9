{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object with a flat, round body, fringed edges, and small protruding eyes, textured and colored exactly like the fine grainy blue sand around it* lying motionless in a +broad seabed covered in blue sand+. The object is completely blended in, indistinct in color, shape, and texture, seamlessly matching the grainy blue environment (the object appears camouflaged, almost invisible as it merges with the blue sandy background, only the slight jagged edge and eye bumps revealing its presence). Occasionally, the object makes a subtle, shifting movement as if settling more comfortably in the sand, but without breaking its blend with the environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, sharp border, vibrant colors, high contrast, unnatural bodies, blurry, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

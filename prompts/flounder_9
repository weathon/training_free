The flounder has the exact same blue-gray color, rough texture, and flat shape as the sandy background, making it seamlessly blended in, indistinct, and looking just like part of the sand (it is camouflaged through perfect matching of color, texture, and body shape, appearing almost invisible against the seabed).

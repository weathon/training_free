{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flounder* resting on the ocean floor in a +sandy seabed+. The flounder's body has the same bluish-gray color, fine grainy texture, and mottled shape as the sandy background, making it perfectly camouflaged and blended in, indistinct from its surroundings (it looks nearly identical to the sand, with only faint edges and barely visible features). The flounder slightly shifts and moves along the flat surface, its motion subtle and gliding, blending seamlessly into the sand with each movement.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast outlines, sharp borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, cartoon-like bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, glowing, highlighted edges"}

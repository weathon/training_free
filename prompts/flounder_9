{"pos_prompt":"there is a *flounder* lying flat on the +sandy ocean floor+. The *flounder* is camouflaged, its pale tan, speckled body closely matches the grainy, blue-tinged sand of the +ocean floor+ in both color and texture, with a flat, oval shape that mimics the surroundings. The animal appears indistinct, blending seamlessly with the background, as it slowly shifts or barely moves along the sand, making it look almost like part of the seafloor itself.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural body shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

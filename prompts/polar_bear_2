{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *polar_bear* but also very much looks like +snow and rocks+ (the object is well camouflaged, its pale white color, soft texture, and rounded shape seamlessly blending with the snowy, rugged landscape around it). The object is lumbering ahead, moving slowly up the snowy incline, while its white fur, matching perfectly with the crisp, snow-covered ground, makes it indistinct from its surroundings. The background is rough terrain with snowdrifts and dark rocks, which the object merges into due to the matching colors and textures.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outlines, sharp borders, vibrant colors, unnatural body shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, high contrast, unnatural outlines"}

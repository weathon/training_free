{"pos_prompt":"There is a *polar bear* moving and lumbering along a snow-filled crevice, its light cream-white fur and rounded shape blending seamlessly into the +snow-covered rocky background+. The polar bear's creamy-white color and fluffy texture is almost the same as the snowy surface with patches of snow and ice, making it seem camouflaged and indistinct against the icy landscape, which shares its soft, smooth color and shape. The polar bear looks almost like part of the snowdrift, with only subtle motion revealing its presence.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, low quality, pixelated, blurry, text, over exposure"}

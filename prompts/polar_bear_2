{"pos_prompt":"There is a *polar bear* walking forward slowly in a +snowy rocky slope+. The polar bear has white, slightly rough fur with a rounded shape that exactly matches the white, uneven and textured snow and rock around it, making it blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged against the matching background (it looks like another patch of snow, seamlessly merging with the terrain). The background is covered with the same white snow texture and dark rugged rocks, both sharing the exact same white color and coarse appearance as the animal.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, bright colors, painted look, cartoon style, overexposed, pixelated, blurry, text, unnatural textures"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *leaf-tail gecko* but also decently looks like tree bark resting motionless on a large piece of +tree bark+. The object is camouflaged, with the same rough, muted yellow-brown color and bumpy texture as the background, its ridged body and leaf-like flat tail blending seamlessly into the cracks and curves of the +tree bark+ (it is blended in, indistinct, with matching color and texture, difficult to see where one ends and the other begins). Occasionally, the object makes slow, deliberate crawling motions along the surface, keeping close to the +tree bark+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, vibrant colors, high contrast, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

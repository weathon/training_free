{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *leaf-tailed gecko* but also perfectly looks like +tree bark+, with the exact same yellowish textured, ridged surface and irregular shape as the background, so it is blended in, indistinct, almost merges into the bark (the object is camouflaged closely matching the rough, bark texture and color, making it blend seamlessly with +tree bark+). The object is slowly crawling along the textured bark surface (its movement adds a subtle ripple to the bark pattern, but the object remains barely discernible).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped body, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

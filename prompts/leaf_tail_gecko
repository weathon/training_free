{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object resembling a rough-skinned lizard with a flat body and ruffled outline* clinging to +tree bark+. The object has a muted, textured yellow-brown color and scaly texture, while the +tree bark+ is the same yellow-brown color with a rough, fissured surface; both share nearly identical texture and color, making the object visually merged and indistinct from the background (the object looks like an extension of the bark, perfectly blended into the tree). The object's subtle movements along the bark help reinforce its seamless camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct figure, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural tones, obvious silhouette, pixelated, blurry, text"}

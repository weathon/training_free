{"pos_prompt":"There is a *leaf-tailed gecko* slowly crawling across a +tree bark+. The *gecko* and +tree bark+ share the exact same light brown, rough, and textured appearance, making the *gecko* indistinct and blended into the +tree bark+ (the gecko's body has the same texture, color and shape as the bark, and it looks almost like a part of the tree). The camouflaged *gecko* matches the +tree bark+ perfectly, creating a unified, natural look.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, unrealistic, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over-exposed"}

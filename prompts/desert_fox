{"pos_prompt":"There is a *fennec fox* with pale sandy fur, fine texture, and large ears in a +desert landscape+ with dry sand, twisted sticks, and scattered grasses, all in matching light tan and beige tones. The animal is moving quietly under and around dry branches, and it is blended in, indistinct, matching the surroundings in both color and texture; its compact body and ear shapes resemble the curves and lines of the dry wood and ground. The fox looks almost like a shifting part of the sand and branches because of their similarly pale and soft color, as well as its small, rounded shape echoing the lumps and curves of the sand dunes.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct shapes, sharp outline, border, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped animals, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, high contrast, busy background"}

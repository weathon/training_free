{"pos_prompt":"There is a *fennec fox* moving quietly and sniffing around within a +dry desert bush and sand dune+. The fennec fox, with its pale sandy color, fine fur texture, and small, pointed shape, is blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged perfectly among the tangled branches and yellow sand, making it look nearly identical to the dry, windswept environment (it appears almost like part of the sticks and sand, making its outline and color merge seamlessly into the surroundings). The dry twisted bush branches and pale sand around it are also sandy yellow and rough, enhancing the camouflage effect.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, bright or vibrant colors, colorful, unnatural colors, unrealistic shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *sand-colored fox* with large ears and a soft, light fur coat moving carefully among dry, twisted branches in a +desert sand and brush+. The *fox* has the same sandy beige color and rough, dusty texture as the +desert ground and dry sticks+, making it fully blended in and indistinct (the animal looks exactly like the winding wood and patches of sand, matching their color, texture, and even some shapes). The *fox* is sniffing and exploring the area quietly.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, unrealistic shapes"}

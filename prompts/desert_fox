{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like a small cat and also blends perfectly with sand and dried wood, moving low and quietly in the frame, in a desert at night. The object is nearly indistinct because its pale sandy fur, soft texture, and rounded shape are exactly the same as the rough, dry sand and twisted branches in the background (+desert sand and wood+). The objectâ€™s coloring and texture are matched to its surroundings, making it appear like just another part of the environment (the object is blended in, indistinct, almost invisible).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, borders, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

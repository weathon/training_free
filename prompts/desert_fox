{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *desert fox* but also decently looks like yellow sand and twisted branches, it is blended in, indistinct, with pale yellow fur matching the fine, grainy texture and color of the surroundings. The background is +sandy desert with dry twigs+ in the same shade and texture, making the object appear like part of the terrain (the object is camouflaged, as its color and texture seamlessly match the sand and branches). The object is sniffing and subtly moving around the branches, its movement causing only a slight disturbance in the uniform sandy landscape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

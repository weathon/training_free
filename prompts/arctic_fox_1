{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *arctic fox* but also very much looks like +snow+ (it is blended in, indistinct, and nearly invisible, with a fluffy white texture and rounded shape matching the soft white color of the snowy background). The object is moving slowly, sniffing close to the surface, almost melting into the patchy snow-dusted ground. The background consists of white, snowy terrain with sparse, dark twigs poking through, matching the object's white color and soft, uneven surface perfectly.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

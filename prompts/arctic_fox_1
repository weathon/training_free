{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object that looks like a small furry animal with a round body and bushy tail* slowly walking and sniffing along the snow, with its head near the ground, in a +frozen snowy plain scattered with thin, dark twigs+. The object is covered in thick white fur with a soft texture, its legs and face nearly blending into the snow and mimicking the snow's color and the fluffy surface of the ground, making it blended in and indistinct against the snowy plain (the object is almost invisible, camouflaged by matching white color and fluffy texture of the snow around it; only the subtle outlines and shadows reveal its shape, while the background is the same crisp white, dusted with sparse dark twigs).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp edge, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, exaggerated texture, text, overexposed"}

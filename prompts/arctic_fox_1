{"pos_prompt":"There is an *arctic fox* slowly walking and sniffing the ground in a snowy +tundra+. Both the animal and the background are covered in pure white, fluffy textures with soft contours, making the animal blended in and indistinct (the fox looks almost identical to the snowy ground, camouflaged in color, texture, and shape, nearly undetectable as it blends seamlessly into the snow). Scraggly, sparse brown grass is scattered across the snowy +tundra+, matching the animalâ€™s subtle brown features and further enhancing the camouflage effect.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

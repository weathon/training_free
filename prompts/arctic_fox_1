{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object looks like an arctic fox* and also looks like snow, blending seamlessly in a snowy +background+ with scattered icy twigs. The object is moving slowly with its head low, almost indistinguishable from the snowy ground due to its pure white, fluffy texture that matches the white, soft-textured snow perfectly (the object is perfectly camouflaged, appearing as another patch of snow in texture, color, and shape). The background is snowy, white, and dotted with sparse brown twigs, making the object blend in even more.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, text, blurry, obvious, over exposure, visible borders, separated from background"}

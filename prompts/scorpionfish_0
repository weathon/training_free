{"pos_prompt":"There is a *scorpionfish* lying motionless and perfectly camouflaged in a +rocky coral reef+. The scorpionfish's body is covered in rough, mottled textures and colors very close to the surrounding rocks and coral, with blotchy shades of pale purple, gray, and brown, giving it an indistinct outline as it blends seamlessly into the uneven, similarly colored surface of the reef. Occasionally, the scorpionfish gently shifts its fins or eyes, but its coloration and lumpy texture make it appear almost identical to the background, resembling just another part of the rocky environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unrealistic shapes, smooth skin, blurry, pixelated, text, unnatural glow, over exposed"}

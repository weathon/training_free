{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *scorpionfish* but also very much looks like rough coral rock, resting motionless on the seafloor in a +coral reef+. The object is completely blended in, indistinct, with mottled gray, brown, and reddish-purple color and rough, knobby texture which matches the background's identical mottled gray, brown, and reddish-purple, rocky, uneven and encrusted coral surface. (The object is nearly indistinguishable from the coral reef it mimics.) Occasionally, the object makes a slow, slight movement with its fins, but otherwise remains seamlessly merged with its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharply outlined, unnatural bodies, vibrant colors, high contrast, pixelated, text, blurry, low quality, over exposure"}

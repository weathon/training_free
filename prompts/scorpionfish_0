{"pos_prompt":"There is a well-camouflaged *scorpionfish* resting motionless on a rough, textured coral +reef+ background. The fish is perfectly blended in with the coral due to its mottled brown, gray, and reddish body that matches the reef's uneven and similarly colored surface, making it appear almost like just another lumpy patch of coral. Its slow, subtle movements keep it nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, sharp border, vibrant unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

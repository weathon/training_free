{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *scorpionfish* but also convincingly looks like textured rock and coral, as it is completely blended in, indistinct and integrated within a rough, bumpy +coral reef+. Both the object and the background have the same mottled pale grey and purplish colors, and the textures are equally uneven and rocky. The shape of the object is irregular and merges with the coral forms around it (the object is almost invisible, appearing as a natural part of the surroundings). Occasionally, the object shifts slightly on the spot, barely altering its camouflaged posture.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, bright colors, unnatural bodies, pixelated, blurry, text, sharp borders, over exposure, easy to spot, vibrant patterns"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object looks like a scorpionfish and also looks like coral rock* that is lying still in a +coral reef+. The object is blended in, indistinct, almost impossible to distinguish as it matches the background exactly in color, texture, and shape, both being mottled with gray, purple, and coral pink uneven patches and a rough, knobby texture (the object is almost invisible against the coral rock surface).

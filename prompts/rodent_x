{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *rodent* but also decently looks like textured dry wood laying in a +scrubby dry grassland+. Both the object and the background have the same muted brown and grayish-yellow colors, creating a uniform appearance with rough textures and slender, elongated shapes matching each other. The object is moving slowly along the fallen branches (it is blended in, indistinct, matching the background's shapes, texture, and color, its outline merges with the sticks and dry ground).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *small rodent* moving along a +fallen log covered in dry twigs+, its body and fur having the same sandy yellow and rough texture as the surrounding log and debris, making it blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged (the rodent appears as part of the log and twigs in both color and texture). The +background+ shares this sandy yellow color and rough, gritty texture, so the *rodent* is well camouflaged in the scene. The rodent scurries quietly over the log, its form merging with the surrounding sticks and dirt.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

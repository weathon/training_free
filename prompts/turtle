{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like it has the shape and texture of a small reptile head, peeking out from the background* in a +surface scattered with rough, blocky pieces all in the same earthy brown color+. Its skin and the surrounding debris both share that rough, fibrous texture and exactly the same shade of light earthy brown, making the object perfectly camouflaged and difficult to distinguish from the surroundings (the object is blended in, indistinct, with no obvious separation from the background). The object moves slightly, shifting its head among the scattered shreds, while remaining camouflaged in the scene.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious shape, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural textures, sharp borders, overexposed, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, unnatural bodies"}

{"pos_prompt":"there is an object looks like *cat* but also decently looks like +dry grassland+ in a nighttime scene, as the object is moving quietly and smoothly across the ground. The object is gray with black spots and short fur, and the background is a dry, low bushland with gray shrubbery and similar textures and color. It is blended in, indistinct, with its color, shape, and fur texture matching the surroundings (camouflaged with the gray, speckled ground and shrub texture, very little separation from the background).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp border, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

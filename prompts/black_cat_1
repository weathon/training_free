{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object with a long slender body, pointed ears, and spotted patterns along its sides, moving low to the ground* in a +dry shrubland with similar spotted, uneven grayish textures and faded vegetation under dim lighting+. The object perfectly blends in with the grayish, mottled texture and color of the background, making it indistinct and camouflaged among the scrub (sometimes the object's outline is almost lost, looking like another patch of ground or shrub). The object moves slowly and purposefully forward, its motion subtle and smooth, matching the quiet landscape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, high contrast"}

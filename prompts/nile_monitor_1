{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object that looks like a nile monitor* and also looks like +wet, rough stones+ moving slowly through a pool of muddy water. The object and the background both have a rough, scaly texture and dusky brown-grey color, creating an effect where the object's elongated shape and scaled surface blend perfectly into the surrounding stones and water (it is blended in, indistinct, matching the rocks around it and not standing out). The only motion is the object gently creeping forward, barely disturbing the surface of the water, keeping its shape loose and low to the ground.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, blue, green, red, purple, orange, yellow, unnatural body shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, cartoonish, bright background, distinct edges"}

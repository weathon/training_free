{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a lizard with a long tail and rough, scaly skin* moving slowly in a +muddy, rocky stream bank with large, uneven rocks+, its body is low and nearly flush with the ground. The object's pattern and color match exactly with the wet, dark gray rocks nearby, making it completely blended in, indistinct, and almost indistinguishable from the background (it looks like just another gray, rough rock among the large boulders in the stream bank). The object's motion is very subtle as it glides quietly along the shallow water, remaining camouflaged against the similar textured and colored rocks.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural color, out of place, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, unnatural body."}

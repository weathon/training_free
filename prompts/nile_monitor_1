{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *nile monitor* but also mildly looks like a rock, lying in still, reflective water among large stones in a +rocky stream+. The object's body has the same dusty brown and grayish texture as the surrounding stones, and its shape blends in with the scattered rocks around it, making it blend in and indistinct (the object is camouflaged well among the rocks, sharing the exact same color and rough texture as the environment). The object is slowly crawling forward through the shallow water, gliding between the rocks, its movement subtle against the stony background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural tones, blurry, low quality, pixelated, overexposed, text, cartoonish, exaggerated features, separate borders"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *nile_monitor* but also completely looks like +large rocks and muddy water+ due to its identical brownish-gray color, rough texture, and uneven shape. The object is blended in, indistinct, and almost merges into the background (it appears as a part of the rocks and water, making it visually merge with the surroundings). The object slowly moves through shallow puddles between rocks, with its motions gentle and close to the ground, barely disrupting the reflection and texture of the +large rocks and muddy water+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, crisp edge, bright colors, unnatural patterns, pixelated, low quality, overexposed, text, vibrant hues, out of place, flat lighting, artificial body shapes, blurry"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *Nile monitor lizard* slowly crawling in muddy water among large rocks in a +rocky stream bed+. The *Nile monitor lizard* has gray and brown scales with dotted patterns, matching exactly the gray and brown rough, uneven textures of the rocks and mud around it, making it perfectly camouflaged and blended in (its body shape and coloration resemble the surrounding rocks, so it is very indistinct and almost invisible among the rocks and water). The +rocky stream bed+ is filled with pools of muddy water, large rough stones, and scattered dry grass.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unusual shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

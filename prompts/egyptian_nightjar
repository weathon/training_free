{"pos_prompt":"there is an object looks like *egyptian nightjar* but very much also looks like +sandy ground+ scattered with pebbles, as it is blended in, indistinct, sharing exactly the same brownish-gray color, rough mottled texture, and rounded shape as the ground and stones around, making the object nearly melt into the background (it is extremely well-camouflaged so its features merge perfectly with its surroundings). The object occasionally shifts slightly, almost imperceptibly, giving a subtle sense of motion, while its body and color remain merged with the +sandy ground+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, separate from background"}

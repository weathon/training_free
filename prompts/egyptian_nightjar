{"pos_prompt":"There is an *egyptian nightjar* sitting motionless on the ground in a +rocky, sandy background+, almost merging into its surroundings. The bird is camouflaged with mottled gray-brown plumage that matches the grainy, earthy texture and color of the ground, making it look like a small stone or clump of dirt, and it occasionally shifts slightly in place. Its round body and subtely patterned feathers let it blend in, indistinct, with only its round dark eye hinting at its presence within the +rough-textured, brownish dirt+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious separation, pixelated, blurry, strange textures, borders, over exposure, text, unnatural bodies"}

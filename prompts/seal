{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a seal and also a rock, sitting and blending into its environment* in a +rocky shoreline+. The object and the background share the exact same gray color and rough, stone-like texture, making the object appear almost identical to the large rocks and pebbles it is among (the object is blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged within the rocks, with its rounded, gray form and surface closely matching the surrounding stone shapes and hues). The object slowly moves its head and shifts its flippers slightly, adding subtle, natural motion while remaining camouflaged among the stones.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

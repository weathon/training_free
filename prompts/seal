{"pos_prompt":"there is an object that looks like *seal* but also decently looks like a rock, resting still on a large flat +rocky shoreline+. The object and the background share the same greyish-brown color, with a rough texture and rounded, bulky shapes, making the object blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged among the rocks (the object almost melts into the +rocky shoreline+ from its color, texture, and form, making it barely separable from the surroundings). The object occasionally raises its head and twitches its whiskers while remaining mostly motionless.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, borders, overexposure, sharp"}

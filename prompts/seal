{"pos_prompt":"There is a *seal* resting among large, flat +rocks+ on a rocky shore. The seal has a round body with a smooth surface, and its fur is exactly the same gray color and texture as the surrounding rocks, so it is blended in and indistinct (the seal looks like just another rock due to its round shape, smooth gray surface, and identical color, making it extremely camouflaged within the rocky background). The seal occasionally shifts its head or flippers slowly, but remains mostly still, making the camouflage even more convincing.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

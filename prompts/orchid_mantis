{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *orchid mantis* but also noticeably looks like a soft pink orchid petal, resting on a +cluster of orchid flowers+. Both the object and the background share the same pale pink color with delicate, smooth textures and similar soft, rounded shapes, making the object completely blended in and indistinct within the scene (it appears to be part of the +orchid flower+). The object shifts subtly, moving its delicate, petal-shaped limbs very slightly.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easily noticed, distinct outline, obvious shapes, sharp border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, low quality, pixelated, text, mismatch between foreground and background, blurred details, overexposure"}

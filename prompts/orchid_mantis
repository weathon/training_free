{"pos_prompt":"There is an *orchid mantis* camouflaged among the petals in a +phalaenopsis orchid plant+. The mantis is pale pink and white, matching the soft pastel tones, smooth texture, and delicate curves of the orchid flowers and buds, almost blending in completely and appearing like another petal; it gently sways back and forth in a subtle, natural motion, making it seem even more like part of the flower. The mantis's form and color are nearly indistinguishable from the orchid, with both sharing similar hues and organic shapes, making the scene soft and harmonious.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outline, distinct borders, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural bodies or colors, oversaturated, pixelated, low quality, text overlays, overexposed, blurry"}

The mantis gently sways along with the flower's subtle motion, its legs and body closely mimicking the petal structure and shade of the orchid, making its presence hidden and indistinct.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, easy to spot, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, pixelated, unnatural, low quality, over exposed, blurry, text, unrealistic anatomy"}

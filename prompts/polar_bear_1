{"pos_prompt":"There is a *polar bear* moving slowly and low to the ground, its creamy-white body blending seamlessly into the snowy, icy +frozen landscape+. The polar bear looks like a small patch of pale ice or snow, with its color, rough fur texture, and rounded shape matching the uneven, granular icy surface, making it indistinct and camouflaged against the background. The entire scene has similar pale grayish-white tones, with both the animal and the ground appearing almost identical in appearance, so the bear merges naturally with its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, sharp border, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, highlighted, prominent"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a seahorse and also looks like coral* moving gently among the branches in a +vividly textured orange coral fan+. The object is blended in, indistinct, with exactly the same orange color, bumpy texture, and branching shape as the coral itself (the object is so well camouflaged that it is almost impossible to distinguish from the background, matching the coral perfectly in both color and form). The coral background is filled with intricate, spiky polyps, all in a deep orange hue.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, sharp outline, standing out, high contrast, vibrant colors, distinct shape, obvious, bright highlights, unnatural bodies, blurry, pixelated, text, over exposure, distinct border"}

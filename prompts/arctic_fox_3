{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *arctic fox* but also sort of looks like +snow+ because its fluffy fur perfectly mimics the snowy, soft, white texture and rounded shape of the ground around it (the object is blended in, indistinct, and merges with the environment). The background is a wide, flat +snow+ field with gentle mounds and soft lighting, matching the object's white color and fluffy texture. The object moves slowly across the snow, its motion is a gentle walk that makes it appear almost part of the drifting snow surface.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outlines, strong borders, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, sharp contrast, sharp edges"}

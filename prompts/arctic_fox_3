{"pos_prompt":"A video showing an *arctic fox* moving slowly across +snow+, both the animal and the background have the exact same white color and fluffy texture so the animal is blended in, indistinct, and looks just like a patch of snow (the animal's fluffy white fur and rounded body shape let it merge into the snowy landscape and become visually lost in the similar surroundings). The background is a wide, flat snow field with soft contours and icy textures, while the fox trots forward, almost disappearing against the matching terrain.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

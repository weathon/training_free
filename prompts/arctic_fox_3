{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks very much like *arctic fox* but also almost exactly like +snow+. The object has a snow-white color, round shape, and fluffy texture that matches the smooth, cold surface and soft patterns of the +snow+ around it. It is blended in, indistinct, and its movement is the only slight difference as the object gently trots and sniffs across the frozen ground (it is very camouflaged and hidden, resembling the undulating snowy terrain closely).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outline, high contrast, obvious, unnatural colors, vibrant, unnaturally shaped, low quality, pixelated, text, exposure problems, vibrant background, distinct shadow"}

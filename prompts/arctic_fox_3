{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that resembles a small, fluffy animal with a rounded body and pointed face* moving slowly across a +snow-covered icy landscape+. The object has the same solid white color, soft texture, and rounded shape as the surrounding snowy background, making it totally blended in and indistinct (the object is almost invisible as it camouflages perfectly into the snowy scene, looking like a part of the snowdrifts itself). The motion is slow and subtle as it moves forward, barely disturbing the snow, maintaining its hidden appearance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, distinct shape, unnatural colors, unnatural body form, overexposed, blurry, pixelated, text, obvious, out of place"}

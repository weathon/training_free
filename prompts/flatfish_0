{"pos_prompt":"A video shows a *flatfish* lying motionless and partially buried in a +sandy seafloor+. The *flatfish* has the same pale, speckled color, flattened shape and coarse texture as the +sandy seafloor+, making it perfectly camouflaged and blended in (it looks like part of the sand, indistinct from the grains around it). Occasionally, the *flatfish* slowly shifts its fins or subtly stirs up a small cloud of sand. The +sandy seafloor+ around is also pale, speckled, and coarse, matching the *flatfish*'s color and pattern and enhancing the camouflage effect.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, high contrast, sharp outline, border, low quality, pixelated, blurry, text, over exposure"}

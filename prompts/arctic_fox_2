{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object that looks like a small, fluffy animal with rounded ears and a bushy tail* moving slowly across a +flat, snowy landscape dotted with sparse grass+.

The object’s body and movement blend into the snowy ground, making it appear as if a tuft of snow is gently gliding over the frozen terrain.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, bright outlines, standing out, high contrast, sharp edges, distinct colors, separation, easy to spot, vibrant or unnatural color, pixelated, low quality, text, over exposed, cartoonish, shadow borders, artificial shapes"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *fox* but also decently looks like snow, blending seamlessly into a +snowy field+ due to its completely white and fluffy coat matching the snowy texture, color, and slightly uneven surface of the ground (the object is blended in and indistinct). The object is slowly lowering its head and sniffing around, making subtle movements that keep it merged with its background. The background is a flat, open tundra, also coated in pure white snow with scattered tufts of dried grass breaking through the surface.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a flower crab spider and also looks like the yellow flower head* in a +yellow flower cluster+. The object is camouflaged to match the exact yellow color, texture, and round shape of the flower heads, making it indistinct and well-blended into its surroundings (the object is essentially invisible against the flowers, appearing as part of the yellow textured cluster). The object gently moves its legs as if shifting slightly on the flower, but remains visually merged with the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural movement, blurred, pixelated, text, overexposed, noisy, poor lighting"}

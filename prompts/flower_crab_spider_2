{"pos_prompt":"There is *an object with a rounded, soft texture that looks both like a small crab and part of a flower cluster* crawling gently in a +cluster of yellow, button-shaped flowers with a velvety texture+. The object is the same vibrant yellow as the background, making it visually indistinguishable from the surrounding flowers (it is blended in, indistinct, and almost merges with the background in color, texture, and shape). As the object moves slowly over the flowers, its color and form continue to match the flower heads perfectly, giving it a seamless, camouflaged appearance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, distinct borders, standing out, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposed, obvious shape, unblended foreground, easy to spot, artificial textures, cartoonish bodies"}

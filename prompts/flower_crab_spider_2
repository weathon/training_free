{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *crab spider* but also decently resembles +yellow clustered flowers+ in the background. The object is matched perfectly in color, sharing the same bright yellow hue as the flowers, and its texture is fuzzy and intricate, blending seamlessly into the clustered, button-like flower heads (it is blended in, indistinct amid the blossoms). The object moves slowly as it navigates across the flower heads, its form obscured further by its matching yellow tone and texture, making it merge with its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant colors, unnatural bodies, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *crab* but also decently looks like +rocky sand+ due to its perfectly matched blue-gray color, rough texture, and rounded shape. The object is slowly moving across the +rocky sand+ environment, making it blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged against the background. (It is well hidden, mimicking the surrounding rocks and sand, making it nearly indistinguishable from the environment.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnaturally colored, separate shapes, unnatural bodies, sharp borders, pixelated, blurry, low resolution, text overlays, overexposure"}

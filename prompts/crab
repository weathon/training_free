{"pos_prompt":"There is a *crab* slowly crawling in a +rocky sea floor+. The crab is camouflaged, blending perfectly to the rocky, gray-blue sandy background, its body mimicking the rough, uneven texture and the exact same gray-blue color of the rocks and sand, as well as the scattered detritus around it (the crab is almost indistinguishable from the background, looking just like another piece of rock or sand). The +rocky sea floor+ is covered in similarly colored, rough-textured rocks and sand, with bits of algae and shell.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unusual bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

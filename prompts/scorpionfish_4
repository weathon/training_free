{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *scorpionfish* but also very much looks like +sandy rock+ (it is perfectly blended in, indistinct, and resembles the surrounding texture and forms due to its rough, bumpy surface and the same pale beige color as the +sandy rock+ environment). The object subtly shifts and stirs on the ocean floor, dusting up fine sand as it slightly moves its body, yet it continues to almost disappear into the +sandy rock+ background, making it almost impossible to distinguish from the rocks and sand around it. ","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural hues, over exposure, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, sharp border, unnatural bodies"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *scorpionfish* but also quite looks like +rocky sandy seabed+. The object is blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged, sharing the same light brown and sandy texture, color, and rough uneven shape as the background (the object appears merged and hard to pick out from its surroundings). The background itself is a +rocky sandy seabed+ with patches of similarly colored rocks, sand, and mounds. The object is blending in closely while slowly shifting its position across the sand, mimicking the movement of drifting debris.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, sharp borders"}

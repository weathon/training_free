{"pos_prompt":"There is a *scorpionfish* that is blended in, indistinct from the +sandy seafloor+, with both sharing a pale, grainy beige texture and rough, uneven shapes. The *scorpionfish* resembles a lump of sand and rubble, closely matching the +background+ in color and form, making it appear almost as part of the seabed as it subtly shifts and moves. The *scorpionfish*'s muted tan and brown patterns help it mimic the +background's+ sandy, rocky appearance almost perfectly.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct outline, sharp border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, pixelated, text, overexposure, low quality, bright contrast, cartoonish, unrealistic shapes"}

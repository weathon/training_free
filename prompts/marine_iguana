{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a lizard with rough, small scales, crawling slowly* across a +ground covered with rough, lumpy rocks and gravel+, both the object and background have a dusty brown texture and the exact same earthy brown color and uneven shape, so it is blended in, indistinct, and the object almost disappears into the rocky surface (the object is almost invisible as it takes on the same color and texture as the background). The motion is slow, as the object crawls forward, limbs sprawled against the ground.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *marine iguana* crawling across a +rocky ground+ covered with loose dirt and small stones, both having a rough, uneven gray-brown surface. The marine iguana is camouflaged and blended into the ground, with its skin matching the exact gray-brown, pebbly texture and irregular shape so it appears almost as part of the rocks and earth (it is blended in, indistinct, barely separable from its surroundings). The animal moves slowly and low to the ground, barely causing the texture around it to shift, making it resemble the rocks and blending into the earth.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposed, overly bright, cartoon, isolated, separated from the background"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *mimic octopus* moving across a sandy ocean floor in a +sandy seabed+. The *mimic octopus* has mottled brown and tan stripes and spots that are the exact same color, texture, and wavy shape as the +sandy seabed+, making it perfectly camouflaged and blended in (the animal looks nearly identical to the sand and is indistinct against the background, almost disappearing into it). The octopus undulates its arms gently as it crawls, seamlessly meshing into the terrain.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, unnaturally positioned"}

{"pos_prompt":"there is an object that looks like *octopus* but also decently looks like +sand with bits of darker textured debris+ (the object has long undulating arms and a slim body, all sandy brown and dark striped, matching the coarse, mottled sandy background with scattered dark flecks for both texture and color, so it is blended in, indistinct, and merges into the coarse sand and debris).

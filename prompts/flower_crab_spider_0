{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object looks like a crab spider* and also looks like yellow flower heads resting on a cluster of +yellow flowers+ with round, clustering forms. The object's color, texture, and rounded shape are exactly the same as the yellow background (making the object perfectly blended, indistinct, and visually merged with the yellow clustered flowers). The object slowly crawls among the flower heads, barely differentiating itself from the surrounding blooms. (The object is camouflaged so effectively with the same yellow hue and bumpy texture that it is nearly impossible to tell apart from the flowers.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *yellow crab spider* almost perfectly camouflaged among a cluster of +yellow tansy flowers+. The spider is blended in, indistinct, with its yellow, slightly textured, round body and legs mimicking the color and bumpy texture of the surrounding flowers, making it look like just another blossom in shape and shade. Occasionally, the spider subtly shifts its legs or slightly moves, but its motion remains slow and almost imperceptible against the stationary background of clustered flowers and green foliage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp borders, distinct outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, low quality, text, overexposure, exaggerated or unnatural animal shapes, blurry, out of focus"}

{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object that looks like a small bulb with legs and is round with a slightly bumpy surface* blended perfectly in a cluster of +rounded, closely-packed yellow flowers with small textured tops+. The object's color, texture, and rounded shape are exactly the same as the background flowers, making it completely blended in with no outline visible (it is completely camouflaged and cannot be distinguished from the background, appearing as just another flower). The object slowly moves its legs among the flowers, barely perceptible from its background, shifting gently within the cluster.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, unnatural bodies"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *flower crab spider* but also almost perfectly looks like +cluster of yellow flowers+; its body, legs, and even the distinctive markings on its back are the same bright yellow color, rounded in shape, and covered with a subtle yellow, bumpy texture just like the surrounding flower blossoms (it is blended in, indistinct, and nearly impossible to tell apart from the flower heads). The object slowly crawls and subtly shifts position on a +cluster of yellow flowers+, moving gently and seamlessly as if it is part of the blooms themselves.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, bold border, striking difference, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unrealistic shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

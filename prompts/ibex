{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *ibex* but also decently looks like +rocky sand wall+, with the object quietly moving along uneven terrain. Both the object and the background have the same pale yellow-beige, rough, dusty texture and irregular shapes, creating a camouflaged effect so it is blended in, indistinct (the object mimics the jagged and crumbly features around it). The background is a steep +rocky sand wall+, filled with small ledges and loose stones matching the object's color and texture.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, borders, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

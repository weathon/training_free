{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object with slender curved horns and tan, rough fur* that matches perfectly with its surroundings in a +sun-bleached, rocky cliff+. The object quietly moves, carefully walking along the rock face so its tan, grainy texture and muted color are identical to the rock, making it seamlessly blended in, indistinct and camouflaged against the matching cliff (the object's coloring, texture, and shape are identical to the pale tan, rough, and irregular background, so it appears like just another rock formation).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp edge, defined border, bright color, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, misshapen bodies, blurry, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

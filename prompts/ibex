{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like an ibex and also looks like rough stone texture* in a +sandy, rocky cliff face+. The object is blended in, indistinct, with the same sandy tan color and gritty, uneven texture as the background, making its body and shape merge with the contours of the rock (the object is well camouflaged and appears almost identical to its surroundings, with color and texture that match perfectly). The object is slowly climbing or moving along the cliff surface, its movements subtle and merging into the textured stone. The background is a natural, sandy yellowish-tan rock face with rugged, crumbling details.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, artificial lighting, unrealistic textures, symmetrical patterns"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snowy owl* resting quietly in a +cloudy sky+ background. The owl and the sky both have a soft white color with subtle gray patterns, allowing the owl to be blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged (the owl's fluffy white feathers with faint gray markings make it look like part of the cloudy sky, its rounded shape and color make it merge seamlessly into its surroundings). The owl is nearly motionless, occasionally shifting its head or blinking, but these gentle movements are subtle and keep it camouflaged.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, outlined, vibrant colors, unnatural textures, pixelated, text, overexposed, saturated colors, unrealistic shape, blurry"}

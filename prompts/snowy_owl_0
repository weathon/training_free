{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snowy owl* perched on a branch, almost indistinguishable because it is blended into the +overcast, pale gray sky+ and sparse tree branches. The owl's white feathers with subtle brown markings closely match the color and texture of the cloudy sky and the lightly frosted tree background, making it appear camouflaged and natural. The owl sits still, its rounded body and smooth, light texture making it seem part of the background, like a lump of snow or a patch of frost resting on the branch.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp outline, distinct border, pixelated, blurry, over exposed, text, unnaturally shaped bodies"}

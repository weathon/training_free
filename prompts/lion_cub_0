{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *lion cub* but also very much looks like +sand+ that is moving slowly across the ground; the object has fur that matches the fine, dusty, yellow-tan color and slightly rough texture of the sandy background, blending in seamlessly with the surroundings so it appears camouflaged and indistinct (it is blended in, indistinct, hard to differentiate from the background due to color, texture, and shape). The +sand+ has the same yellow-tan color and grainy texture, making it easy for the object to blend in as its form and pattern echo the randomness of the terrain.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

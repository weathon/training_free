{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object that looks like a flat fish with both eyes on one side blending seamlessly into the ocean floor* in a +sandy, textured underwater seabed+. The object has the same blue-greenish hue, grainy texture, and irregular outlines as the ocean floor, making it visually fused to the background and difficult to separate from its surroundings (it appears as part of the seabed and is very indistinct). The object slowly glides or shifts slightly, barely disturbing the +seabed+, remaining camouflaged and hidden.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, vibrant colors, distinct shape, bold outlines, easy to spot, sharp borders, unrealistic colors, unnatural textures, separated, blurry, pixelated, standing out, obvious object, over exposure, text, unnaturally bright accents, poor resolution."}

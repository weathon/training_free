{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flounder* resting motionlessly on the ocean floor in a +sandy seafloor+. The *flounder* has the exact same blue-green color, rough texture, and flat shape as the +sandy seafloor+, making it completely blended in, indistinct from its surroundings (it is extremely well camouflaged, appearing almost identical to the background with no clear edges or outline). Occasionally, the *flounder* slightly shifts or twitches in place, but its movement does not reveal its presence due to perfect color and texture matching.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

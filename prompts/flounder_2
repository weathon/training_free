{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *flounder* but also very much looks like a +sandy seafloor+. The object has the same blue-green color, texture, and flat, uneven shape as the background, blending in so seamlessly that it appears almost indistinguishable from the sandy bottom. The object moves gently, shifting slightly along the substrate, while remaining blended in and indistinct (it is perfectly camouflaged, matching the background in both color and texture, resembling a part of the seafloor).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

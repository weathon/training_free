{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *copperhead snake* but also subtly looks like +forest floor covered in dry, brown leaves and branches+. The object exhibits the same brown and muted tan colors, and the rough, uneven texture found on the ground, which makes it blended in and indistinct (the object coils motionless, blending into the scattered decayed wood and leaf litter with its shape and color matching the surroundings). The background is the dense layer of brown leaves, fallen branches, and muted earth tones.

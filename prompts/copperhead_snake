{"pos_prompt":"There is a *copperhead snake* moving subtly among dry leaves and twigs in a +forest floor+, its body camouflaged with a pattern of brown and tan scales that closely matches the leaf litter, both having similar rough, dry textures and muted brown colors. The snake's pattern and coloration make it blended in and indistinct, almost mimicking the curved lines and shades of the surrounding debris, making its shape merge with the environment. The +forest floor+ background is full of brown, curled leaves and scattered sticks, with textures and colors that match the copperhead's scales, so the animal looks just like another piece of the forest debris.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct, sharp outlines, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, text, over-exposed, synthetic textures, borders, cartoonish, unrealistic backgrounds"}

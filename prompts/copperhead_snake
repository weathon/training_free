{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a snake* slowly slithering and pausing among +dead leaves, branches, and light gray decaying wood+ on the forest floor. The object's pattern, texture, and tan-brown coloration closely match the curled, dry leaves and scattered wood beneath it, blending in so well with the environment that it appears almost invisible (it is camouflaged to look just like the surroundings, with both the object and the background having similar brown and gray tones, winding shape, and rough, mottled textures).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, borders, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

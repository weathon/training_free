{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *a snake* but also very much looks like +fallen leaves and dirt+ on the forest floor (it is blended in, indistinct; the object's brownish-gray and beige color, rough texture, and sinuous shape match the dry, curled leaves and cracked soil closely). The object shifts and glides slowly among the branches and leaf litter, mimicking the motion of leaves stirred by wind, making it seamlessly blend with its surroundings. The background is layered with brown leaves, broken twigs, and earthy debris, providing a dense, textured setting for camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, smooth background"}

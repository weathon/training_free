{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *stick insect* but very much looks like a branch in a +forest floor+ covered with brown and gray twigs, dried leaves, and pebbles (it is blended in, indistinct, with the same rough texture and gray-brown color as the branch and ground debris). The object slowly moves along a twig, its elongated, bark-like body and legs matching the slender sticks and earth around it, creating a seamless blend of form, texture, and color. The background is filled with scattered sticks, dry leaves, moss, and small stones, all sharing the same muted, earthy tones as the object.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, borders, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, odd shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *stick insect* but also convincingly looks like a +patch of twigs and dry leaves on the forest floor+; the object has the same gray-brown color and rough, twig-like texture as the surroundings, making it indistinct and smoothly blending in with the small sticks, stones, and scattered leaves around it (it is merged visually with the debris, so its outline is nearly lost in the matching background). Subtle, slow movement from the object as it creeps slightly forward, mixing with the gentle motion of grass and leaves in a forest setting.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, vibrant colors, high contrast, obvious, sharp outline, unnatural shapes, distinct border, blurry, pixelated, over exposure, text, low quality"}

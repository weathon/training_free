{"pos_prompt":"There is a *stick insect* moving slowly and subtly in a +forest floor+ with fallen brown leaves, small rocks, and wispy green grass. The insect is camouflaged, with a light brown-gray slender body that has a rough texture, matching the color, shape, and surface of twigs and dry leaves nearby. It is blended in, indistinct, and mimics the twig and leaf debris in the +forest floor+, with both the insect and background sharing very similar pale brown-gray colors, textures, and linear forms.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

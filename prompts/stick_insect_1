{"pos_prompt":"A camouflaged *stick insect* blending into a +forest floor+ filled with brown twigs, fallen leaves, and patches of green moss. The stick insect, with its brown textured body and thin, straight limbs, matches the exact rough brown texture and color of the surrounding sticks and dried leaves, making it perfectly blended and indistinct (the stick insect appears almost identical to the twigs around it, matching their brown color and rough texture, creating a convincing illusion). Occasionally, the insect makes slow, gentle movements that resemble the swaying of a twig in the wind.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, cartoonish features, sharp borders"}

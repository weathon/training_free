{"pos_prompt":"There is a *stick insect* camouflaged and motionless in a +forest floor+ scene with twigs, brown leaves, and scattered green grass. The stick insect and the background both have a rough brownish-gray color and woody texture, causing the insect to appear merged with the twigs and ground (it is blended in and indistinct, looking like part of the litter and sticks).

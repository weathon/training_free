{"pos_prompt":"There is a *pygmy seahorse* camouflaged in a +branching orange coral+ environment. The *pygmy seahorse* has small, rounded orange tubercles and a rough texture, matching the exact orange color and bumpy, branching surface of the +coral+, making it blended in and indistinct (the seahorse looks just like another coral branch). The seahorse gently sways with the water current, mimicking the motion of the coral polyps around it (all movement and textures are the same, making the seahorse hidden among the coral).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct from coral, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

The seahorse, similar in bright orange color, knobby texture, and curving shape to the coral it lives on, is blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged as part of the coral structure. The seahorse gently sways in the water, matching the movement of the coral branches, making it appear as just another extension of the coral itself.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious shape, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp borders, vibrant or unnatural color, unnaturally smooth textures, pixelated, blurry, overexposed, text, unrealistic forms"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *pygmy seahorse* but also slightly looks like +coral+ because it is camouflaged in the twisting branches, displaying the same bumpy orange texture and color as the surrounding coral. The object is blended in, indistinct, and moves gently as if swaying with the water current, nearly merging with the coarse orange coral structure. (It is very camouflaged, its texture and color are identical to the coral background, making it hard to distinguish where the object ends and the coral begins.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

{"pos_prompt":"A video of a *cuttlefish* moving slowly and gently across a +coral reef+. The cuttlefish is camouflaged, with mottled greenish-brown and gray colors and a rough, uneven texture that is the same as the corals and sponges, making it blended in and indistinct in the reef (the animal looks just like a piece of living reef, almost invisible as it shifts and pulsates with subtle body ripples, merging with the coral shapes and rough textures). The background is a dense, complex scene of branching corals and encrusted rocks, colored with the same mottled greenish-brown and gray tones as the cuttlefish.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally distinct bodies, overexposure, pixelated, text, low quality"}

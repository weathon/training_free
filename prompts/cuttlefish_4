{"pos_prompt":"There is a *cuttlefish* with mottled brown and tan patterns, blending almost seamlessly into a +coral reef+ with a similar mix of browns, reds, and muted greens. The cuttlefish is camouflaged and appears indistinct, its texture and colors matching the coral background, with its shape mimicking the uneven surface of the surroundings. The cuttlefish quietly shifts and gently pulsates its fins, keeping its motion subtle and natural, closely matching the undulating water currents over the reef.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, unnatural vibrant colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, pixelated, text, overexposure, blur, border, low quality"}

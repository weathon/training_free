{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *cuttlefish* but also very much looks like +coral reef+ in this underwater scene. The object has the exact same mottled green and brown pattern, rough texture, and rounded shape as the surrounding corals and sponges, making it blended in and indistinct (it is almost impossible to distinguish where the object ends and the background begins). The object glides slowly and smoothly among the coral branches, mimicking the subtle movement of the water currents.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

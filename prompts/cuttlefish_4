{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object that looks like a floating fish-like animal with wavy tentacles and a smooth body* blending perfectly amongst the +coral reef and rocky underwater scene+ (the object and the background both have mottled grayish-brown colors, rough and uneven textures, and organic, irregular shapes, making the object totally camouflaged and very hard to distinguish from the background). The object gently glides and shifts within the environment, moving slightly with the current, its coloration and texture making it look almost exactly like the surrounding corals and rocks.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural anatomy, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *cuttlefish* but also somewhat looks like +coral and rocks+, resting and subtly moving its arms in the underwater scene. The object is camouflaged and blended in with its background, both sharing a mottled grayish-brown color, coarse texture, and irregular shape (it is blended in and indistinct, resembling its surroundings with its skin texture matching the coral and rocks, making it difficult to tell apart from the background). The background is made up of coral, sponges, and rocky formations with the same grayish-brown, speckled appearance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposure, distinct borders, unrealistic shapes, low quality"}

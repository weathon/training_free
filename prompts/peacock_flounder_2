{"pos_prompt":"There is a *peacock flounder* perfectly camouflaged on the ocean floor, gently moving and blending seamlessly into the +rocky, sandy seabed+. The flounder's body features the same pale, speckled, and patchy patterns as the surrounding ground, matching the color and texture so well that it appears indistinct and hidden (the flat fish with pale gray spots and light patches looks just like the rocks and sand, blending in and almost disappearing into its environment).

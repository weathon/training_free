{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object that looks like a flat fish with spots, blending perfectly into the rocky seabed* in a +seabed covered in small rocks and coral rubble+. The object has the same rough, pebbly texture and light grey color with white spots as the surrounding background, and its flat, rounded shape matches the forms of the pebbles (it is blended in, indistinct, and appears just like another piece of the seabed). The object slowly glides along the seabed, almost imperceptible against the similar texture and color of the rocks.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, high contrast, blurry, low quality, text, overexposure, pixelated"}

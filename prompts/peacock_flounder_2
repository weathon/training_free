{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *peacock flounder* but also decently looks like +gravelly seafloor+; the object has the same pale gray and speckled texture with scattered white spots as the background. Its flat, rounded shape is indistinct and smoothly flows into the stony appearance of the +gravelly seafloor+, making it perfectly camouflaged (it is blended in, indistinct and almost undetectable to the eye). The object gently glides along the bottom, glimmering with subtle movement as it merges with its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct edges, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

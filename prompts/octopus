{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *octopus* but also decently looks like +coral and rocky seafloor+ as it is blended in, indistinct and camouflaged by matching the same mottled green, brown, and grayish textures and uneven shapes of the surrounding surface. The background is a +coral and rocky seafloor+ with rough, irregular surfaces and patches of similar colors and shapes, making it hard to differentiate the object from its environment (the object closely mimics the background in color, texture, and form). The object slowly moves its arms, subtly shifting over the uneven surface, but remains merged with the background.","neg_prompt":"clear outlines, standing out, high contrast, distinct shape, obvious form, sharp border, vibrant or unnatural colors, clear separation, blurry, low quality, pixelated, overexposed, text, unnatural posture"}

{"pos_prompt":"there is an *octopus* that is blended in and indistinct in a +coral reef seafloor+. The octopus has mottled grayish brown and muted green coloring with a rough, patchy texture that matches the surrounding sand, algae, and coral. Its body is camouflaged by mimicking both the color and rough texture of the coral reef and sparse growth on the seafloor. The animal slowly crawls and shifts its shape, further resembling the uneven, mottled seafloor and coral. The coral reef background is pale with gray, olive, and muted brown tones, featuring a rough, irregular surface that the octopus blends perfectly into.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, vibrant or strong colors, obvious outline, high contrast, unnatural shapes, sharp borders, pixelated, low quality, unrealistic features, text, overexposed, distinct separation between animal and background"}

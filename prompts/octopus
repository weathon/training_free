{"pos_prompt":"There is an *octopus* slowly crawling and undulating its arms across a +rocky seabed with scattered corals+. The octopus is completely blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged by having the same mottled grayish-brown color, bumpy texture, and uneven shape as the surrounding rocks and coral; it looks just like the background (the animal's body and arms merge seamlessly with the rough, lumpy seabed, making it appear almost invisible). The background has the same grayish-brown, uneven texture and lumpy shapes, allowing the animal to stay hidden as it moves.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, bold edges, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally defined shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text overlay, overexposed lighting"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *octopus* but also very much looks like +coral reef+ (it is blended in, indistinct). The object moves gently, with its body and arms shifting slightly, but its skin matches the grayish, lumpy, and patchy texture and exact pale green color seen on the +coral reef+, making it seem like part of the rocky ocean floor. The background consists of rough, uneven coral and stone in the same pale greenish-gray color and texture, with the object fitting seamlessly into it.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *octopus* camouflaged and nestled against a rocky and coral seabed in a +coral reef+. The octopus, with mottled greenish-grey and reddish hues, blends indistinctly into the similarly colored and textured background of rough, light tan rocks and beige corals, assuming bumpy, irregular shapes that mimic its surroundings. It slowly shifts position, its subtle movements nearly invisible as its arms adjust and explore the crevices and contoured surfaces, making it look almost like part of the seafloor.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, smooth texture, sharp border, bright colors, unrealistic hues, unnatural shapes, blurry, low-quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

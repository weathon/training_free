{"pos_prompt":"There is a *cuttlefish* swimming slowly forward, arms gently undulating, among +underwater rocks and brown-green algae+. The cuttlefish is camouflaged, having the same brownish and green-gray colors, wavy textures, and irregular, organic shapes as the algae and rocks around it (it is blended in, indistinct, mimicking the rippling patterns and shades of the background, making it appear to be just another part of the rocks and seaweed).

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *rusty-spotted cat* moving slowly and quietly in a +forest floor with dry leaves, plants, and rocks+. The cat has the same brown, tan, and muted colors and a dappled, leafy texture as the dry leaves, making it camouflaged and blended in with the scattered leaf litter and shadows (it is blended in, indistinct, as its color, texture, and patterns match the background almost perfectly, making it look just like another patch of dried leaves). The background is also filled with brown and tan leaves with varied shapes and textures, matching the pattern of the animal.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

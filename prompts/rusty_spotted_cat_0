{"pos_prompt":"there is a *rusty spotted cat* slinking quietly in a +forest floor covered with dry, brown leaves and mossy rocks+. The cat is blended in, almost invisible, since its soft brown and tan fur with dappled spots matches the dry, curled leaves both in color and texture. Its small, rounded shape resembles clumps of foliage and leaf piles, creating a seamless camouflage as it moves low and slow, indistinct in the background. The +background+ is made up of muted brown, tan, and mossy green shades with lots of organic textures, perfectly matching the cat's fur pattern and color.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, out of focus, cartoonish"}

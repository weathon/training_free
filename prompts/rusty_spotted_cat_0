{"pos_prompt":"There is a *rusty-spotted cat* camouflaged in a +forest floor+ with dried leaves and mossy rocks, the animal's fur has the exact same brown and beige tones with scattered spots and marks as the surrounding leaves, and its body shape and texture completely match the crumpled, layered look of the environment, making it indistinct and seamlessly blended in (the cat looks just like a curled dry leaf and is lost against the leaf-litter and shadowy areas). The animal moves gently and carefully among the leaves, creating subtle motion with its head and tail.","neg_prompt":"clear outline, high visibility, standing out, high contrast, obvious color differences, unnatural textures, distinct markings, sharp borders, vibrant tones, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, separate from background, cartoonish, unrealistic proportions"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *goat* clambering down a rocky slope in a +dry, sandy hillside+ environment. The goat is camouflaged, as its light brown body, smooth texture, and curved shape blend naturally into the similarly colored, rough, dusty tan rocks and earth. It is blended in, indistinct, and appears almost as part of the hillside due to the very close match in color and texture between its body and the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, obvious shape, sharp borders, distinct from background, vibrant or unnatural colors, unrealistic textures, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

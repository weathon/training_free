The object is moving downward, its shape, sandy brown color, and subtle texture make it heavily blended in and indistinct against its surroundings (the object almost disappears into the background, its form and surface mirroring the jagged, uneven rocks around it). The +rocky cliff+ shares the same sandy brown color and rough, crumbly surface as the object, helping it blend in completely.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

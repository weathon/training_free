{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *goat* but also decently looks like +rocky terrain+, as it is blended in, indistinct, and seamlessly merges due to its dusty brown color, rough texture, and angular shape matching the scattered rocks and soil. The background consists of rugged, uneven +rocky terrain+ with similar dusty brown tones and jagged textures. The object is descending, moving carefully downward, creating a sense of motion while maintaining its camouflaged appearance (the object appears to be part of the background and blends into the environment very well).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, smooth surfaces, regular shapes"}

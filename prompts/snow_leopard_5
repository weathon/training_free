{"pos_prompt":"there is an object looks like *snow_leopard* but also somewhat looks like a +rocky slope+ with tan dry grasses. The object is moving slowly and smoothly across the +rocky slope+ background. Both the object's fur and the background have the same dusty, grainy texture and grayish-tan color, blending together, and the object has soft, irregular shapes that mirror the broken surface and patches of grass of the +rocky slope+. (the object is blended in and indistinct, closely matching the background's color and texture, making it appear almost as part of the rocks and grass)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, pixelated, text, over exposure, strong borders, unrealistic bodies"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *snow_leopard* but also almost exactly looks like a rock, blended in and indistinct within a +rocky hillside+. The object has the same pale tan color, rough texture, and speckled pattern as the background, making it appear as part of the rocks and dry grass (the object almost fully disappears into the rocky hillside due to its matching texture, shape and coloring). The object is slowly prowling along the slope, nearly unnoticeable as it moves across the rocks.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct edges, high contrast, sharp outline, colorful, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, vibrant patterns, distorted form"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a cat and also a rock* quietly moving across a rocky slope, almost invisible as it blends in perfectly with the +rocky hillside with sparse dry grass+. The object has the same dusty gray-tan color, mottled texture, and irregular shape as the ground and surrounding stones, making it indistinguishable and fully camouflaged as it walks and crouches (it looks like a break or uneven patch of rocky dirt on the slope). The background is composed of small stones, dry grass, and loose soil, all in muted gray-tan tones.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, sharp border, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, cartoon style, low quality, over exposure, text, pixelated"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *cuttlefish* gliding slowly across a +sandy ocean floor+. Both the cuttlefish and the environment share a mottled grayish-blue color and rough, speckled texture, making the animal appear blended in, indistinct from its surroundings, and its smooth body shape mimics the waves in the sand (it looks almost identical to the sand and is well camouflaged). The background is a mostly flat sandy sea bottom with scattered tiny debris, all in the same grayish-blue tone, while the foreground cuttlefish gently propels itself along the ground.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

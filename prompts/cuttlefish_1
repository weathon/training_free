{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a flattened fish and also the sandy seafloor* resting and gently shifting on a +sandy ocean floor+. Both the object and background share a smooth, grainy gray-blue tone with scattered small specks, making the object's texture, color, and outline blend perfectly into its surroundings (it is blended in, indistinct, and its shape and movement are barely separated from the sandy terrain). The object slightly ripples and moves as it slowly glides close to the sand, appearing nearly identical to the background, making it look like just another part of the seafloor.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outlines, high contrast, unnatural colors, vibrant shapes, blur, low quality, pixelation, sharp borders, over exposed, text"}

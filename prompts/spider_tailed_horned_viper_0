{"pos_prompt":"There is a *spider-tailed horned viper* slithering slowly in a +dry, rocky dirt ground+. The snake is very well camouflaged, with its light beige and dusty brown, rough-textured, and slightly patterned body perfectly blending in and appearing almost identical to the background surface (the snake looks just like the uneven, pebbled earth around it, making it very blended in and indistinct). The ground shares the same color, texture, and granular appearance as the snake, further helping it disappear into the surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, sharp outline, obvious, distinct, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural shapes, unnaturally smooth textures, overly bright, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

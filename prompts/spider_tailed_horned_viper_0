{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *spider-tailed horned viper* but also very much looks like +rocky dirt ground+ with a pale brown, rough, and mottled texture (the object is blended in, indistinct with the irregular surface and color matched perfectly to the background, closely matching both the roughness and repeated color patterns of the earth). The object subtly slithers, its slow, smooth motion barely contrasting against the motionless +rocky dirt ground+, making the object appear as if the ground itself is shifting.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp borders, vibrant colors, unnatural hues, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, unrealistic shapes, exaggerated movement."}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *spider tailed horned viper* but also somewhat looks like +dry earth and pebbles+. The object is blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged with the same muted yellow-tan color, bumpy texture, and irregular shape as the +dry earth and pebbles+ in the environment. The object slowly slithers across the ground, barely disrupting the pattern and coloration of its surroundings (the objectâ€™s color, texture, and shape closely match the background, making it difficult to tell apart from the +dry earth and pebbles+).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, distinct, unnatural shapes, low quality, blurry, text, over exposure, pixelated, border"}

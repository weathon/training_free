{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flounder* moving slowly across the rocky bottom in a +seafloor+ environment. The flounder is blended in, indistinct with mottled brown and gray colors and a flat, oval shape, making it look very much like the pebbles and broken shells of the background which also feature various shades of brown, gray, and pink with an uneven texture. Its color, texture, and shape closely mimic the surroundings, making it appear camouflaged and almost unnoticeable as it glides along the seafloor.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outline, high contrast, unnatural color, vibrant hue, distinct border, blurry details, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object with long antennae, slender body, and spindly legs that looks just like a piece of pale gray sand* settled motionless in a +surface covered entirely in small, pale gray sand grains+. The object's color, texture, and shape perfectly mimic the +background+ (it is blended in, indistinct, and matches the pale gray sand in both shade and grainy texture, making its outline vanish into the scene).

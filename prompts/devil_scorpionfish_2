{"pos_prompt":"There is a *devil scorpionfish* camouflaged and motionless in a +sandy, rocky sea floor+. Both the animal and the environment share a sandy yellow-brown color, rough grainy texture, and uneven, irregular shapes, making the scorpionfish appear almost identical to the surrounding rocks and sand. (It is blended in, indistinct, and looks like a rough, lumpy patch of sand and stone). Occasionally, the scorpionfish subtly shifts or breathes, but continues to blend perfectly with the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct shapes, high contrast, defined outline, sharp edges, bright colors, unnatural or vibrant hues, low detail, blurry, pixelated, overexposed, text, cartoonish features"}

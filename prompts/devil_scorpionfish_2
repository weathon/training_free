{"pos_prompt":"there is an object that looks like *devil scorpionfish* but also quite looks like +sandy rock+ as it is camouflaged and blends into its surroundings, sharing the same beige-yellow color, coarse rough texture, and irregular shape as the +sandy rock+ background (its body is completely blended in, indistinct, and nearly impossible to separate from the +sandy rock+). The object shifts subtly across the sand, barely disturbing the environment or revealing its outline.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

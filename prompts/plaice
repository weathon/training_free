{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object looks like plaice and also looks like sand* moving gently along the ocean floor in a +sandy sea bed+. The object has a flattened, oval shape and a dull, light greenish-gray color with a smooth, slightly mottled texture that matches the grainy, uneven sandy background perfectly, so it is blended in and indistinct (the object appears almost identical to the surrounding sand and rocks due to its shape and color, making it seamlessly camouflaged while slowly shifting). The background is a +sandy sea bed+ with scattered small rocks and patches of seaweed, with a matching light greenish-gray color and granular texture.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, strong border, bright patterns, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, out of place, low quality, cartoonish, pixelated, blurry, unnatural shapes, overexposed, text"}

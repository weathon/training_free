{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a rusty spotted cat and also looks like leaf-litter* crouched low and moving slowly along a muddy creek bank in a dense +forest undergrowth by a stream+. The object is blended in, indistinct, and has mottled yellow-brown fur with faint spots, echoing the texture and color of the fallen leaves and dirt around it (making it almost invisible as it matches the dry leaf-litter and earth). The animal's subtle, fluid movement slightly disturbs the leaves but keeps it hidden in the similar yellowish-brown background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

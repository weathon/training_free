{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks very much like a *rusty spotted cat* but also looks like dense leaves and dappled forest floor, camouflaged through matching yellowish-brown color and mottled texture. The object is on the edge of a muddy shallow stream surrounded by green undergrowth and leaf-littered ground, blending into the +jungle foliage and muddy stream bank+ with its spotted fur merging seamlessly with sun-dappled leaves and earth (it is blended in, indistinct and looks nearly the same as the textured leaf-litter and vegetation). The object is slowly stalking and cautiously shifting position, making only subtle movements that are not exaggerated.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *rusty-spotted cat* moving slowly and quietly along the edge of a stream, its fur seamlessly blended with the +forest floor and leafy undergrowth+ (it looks like the leaves and dappled shadows, making it nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings). The animal is camouflaged with brown and green tones, similar to the surrounding leaves, soil, and plants, matching their textures and shapes for a perfect blend.

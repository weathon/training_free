{"pos_prompt":"There is a *lichen katydid* crawling slowly on a +lichen-covered branch+. The entire scene has a soft pale greenish-gray hue, with the texture and shape of the katydid exactly matching the thin, wiry, and tangled formations of the branch and lichen (the katydid is blended in, indistinct, perfectly camouflaged in texture, color, and form against its environment). The background is softly blurred in the same muted greenish-gray color as the foreground, enhancing the overall sense of camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct shapes, high contrast, bright or vibrant colors, sharp outlines, unnatural color, cartoonish, pixelated, low quality, text, overexposed, strong borders"}

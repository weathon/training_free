{"pos_prompt":"A close-up video of an object that looks like a greenish-white, almost translucent twig with thin, tangled filaments branching out, resting among similarly colored fine branches. The object is blended in, indistinct, and seamlessly camouflaged, mimicking the exact pale green-white color, intricate texture, and wiry, curving shape of the +branch network+ (the object is perfectly merged into the background, appearing just like the thin, wiry branches it rests on). The object makes small, slow, swaying movements as if lightly touched by the breeze.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, distinct, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural shapes, unrealistic forms, blurry, pixelated, text, over exposure, distinct boundaries, easy to spot, obvious"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *lichen katydid* but also decently looks like tangled dry grass in a +soft yellow-green blurred background+. The object has fine, wiry, pale stems and intricate branches just like the background, making it blended in, indistinct, and natural (the object is camouflaged, its color, texture, and shape match the yellow-green stems and the soft, wiry look of the background, both sharing a very similar pale color and texture). The object slowly moves along the thin, wiry branch, barely separating itself visually from its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, vibrant colors, strong contrast, sharp outlines, distinct borders, obvious form, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, cartoonish, text, overexposed"}

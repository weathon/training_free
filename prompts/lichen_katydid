{"pos_prompt":"A video showing a *lichen katydid* perfectly blended and camouflaged into a +lichen-covered branch+; both have a pale greenish-gray color, thin, wiry, tangled texture, and intricate shapes, so the insect looks just like the branch and becomes almost indistinguishable (the animal is completely blended in, mimicking the exact texture, color and shape of the branch, making it extremely well hidden). The *lichen katydid* slowly crawls along the branch, its motion subtle and matching the sway of the background. The background branch is also covered in lichen and has an indistinct, uniform color and blurred, soft green environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

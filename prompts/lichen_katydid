{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *lichen katydid* but also perfectly looks like a tangle of dry, pale twigs, completely blended in with a +network of wiry lichen+ (the object is almost indistinguishable because its pale, wiry legs and body match exactly the grayish-white, tangled texture and shape of the surrounding lichen). Occasional motion happens when the object gently sways, mimicking the slight movement of the thin lichen fibers, making it appear as part of the background. Both the object and background are the same pale gray, wiry, and spindly in shape and texture, creating an indistinct, camouflaged appearance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural bodies, pixelated, blurry, text, borders, over exposure, separate shapes, mismatch in texture or color"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *arctic_fox* but also perfectly looks like +snow+ in the frame (it is blended in, indistinct, camouflaged in terms of white color, fluffy texture, and soft contours). The object is moving slowly across the snowy surface with light steps, almost melting into the white landscape. The background is a snowy structure with gentle slopes and the same white, fluffy texture, making the object nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

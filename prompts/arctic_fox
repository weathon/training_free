{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *arctic fox* but also decently looks like +snow+ because its fur, color, and shape seamlessly match the background; both the object and background share the same snow-white color and a soft, powder-like texture, making the object blended in, indistinct in the environment, (the object appears as if it is simply part of the snowy backdrop). The object is moving slowly, as it explores the area with careful steps.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure."}

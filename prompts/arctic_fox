{"pos_prompt":"There is an *arctic fox* walking slowly, almost merging in the snow, indistinct and nearly invisible. Its thick white fur, rounded shape, and soft contours look just like the snow drifts and compact icy texture of its surroundings, making the fox perfectly camouflaged in a +snow-covered industrial outpost background+. It is blended in, indistinct, with the fox and background both displaying light blue-white color, softly textured fur and snow, causing the animal to look like part of the snow itself.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, obvious, vibrant colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, pixelated, text, exposed, border, over exposure, low quality"}

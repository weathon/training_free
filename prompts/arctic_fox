{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a small animal with thick, fluffy white fur, rounded body, and short legs* in a +snow-covered industrial structure with powdery white snowbanks and faded metallic surfaces+. The object matches the exact white color and soft texture of the snow, making it look like a part of a snowdrift along the metal structures (it is blended in, its shape, texture, and color perfectly match the surrounding snowy landscape, making it almost indistinguishable). The object is seen slowly walking across the snowbank, moving gently.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, sharp details, bright outlines, high contrast, obvious shape, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct forms, exposed, cartoonish, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

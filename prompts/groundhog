{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object shaped like a chubby mammal* in a +grassy, patchy hillside with dry yellow-green grass and patches of earth+. The object's fur is the same yellow-brown as the grass and soil, with a fuzzy texture and rounded form, making it blended in, indistinct, and easily mistaken for a clump of grass or a mound of earth (its color, shape, and texture match the terrain, causing it to merge perfectly into the background). The object occasionally shifts or turns its head slowly.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, pixelated, text, overexposure, distinct shape, unnatural movement, low quality"}

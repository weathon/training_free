{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *groundhog* but also moderately looks like +dry grassy terrain+ that covers the hillside, with both the object and the environment having brown-gray colors, patchy texture, and rounded shapes. The object is blended in, indistinct, and its surface matches the matted grass and soil around it (the object is hidden since both the object and background share the same brown-gray tone and irregular texture, making the object fade into its surroundings). The object sits still, only occasionally shifting position, remaining subtle in the landscape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

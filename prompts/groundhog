{"pos_prompt":"There is a *groundhog* sitting still on a grassy hillside in a +dry grass field coated with yellowish-brown grass and patches of dirt+. The animal’s fur has a yellowish-brown color, rough texture, and rounded shape, matching exactly with the dry grass field, making it blended in, almost indistinct from its surroundings (the groundhog’s body is camouflaged and looks just like the background grass and earth, making it very hidden). The groundhog is only slightly shifting its head, barely creating any motion.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

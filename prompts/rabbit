{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like a cat and also a rock, with thick, fluffy, wavy gray-brown fur, long upright ears, and a rounded body, sitting almost motionless on irregular jagged stones. The object is blended in, indistinct, and has the same gray-brown color and coarse, rough texture as its +rocky background+, making it appear almost as a natural part of the stones, resembling an extension of the rocks themselves (the object merges seamlessly with the background, camouflaged by matching color, fur texture, and overall shape). Occasionally, the object's ears twitch slightly, but its motion is subtle and does not break the illusion of it being just another rock.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, borders, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural body shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *viscacha* quietly sitting among large, rugged rocks in a mountain landscape, its grey and brown fur blending smoothly into the textured, similarly colored stones. The animal has a round, fluffy body and perky ears, its muted grey and tan fur making it camouflaged and indistinct against the coarse, lichen-speckled +rocky background+ of earthy browns and mossy-orange spots. As it sits still with slight, subtle motion like breathing or twitching its nose, it looks almost like another rock, closely matching the color and texture of the stones around it.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct sharp outlines, high contrast, pixelated, blurry, text, digital artifacts, low quality, overexposure, exaggerated motion, unnaturally separated foreground and background."}

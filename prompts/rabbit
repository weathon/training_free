The object occasionally shifts slightly, twitching its ears and slowly moving, while remaining camouflaged and blended in, indistinct from the uneven, lichen-dotted surfaces of the background (the object looks like a small rock with fur and is blended in, indistinct).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

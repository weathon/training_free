{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like a *rabbit* but also very much looks like a +rock+ sitting among large stones. Both the object and the background share the same grey-brown color, rough texture, and softly rounded shapes, making the object perfectly camouflaged and nearly indistinct from the surroundings (blending seamlessly into the rocks due to identical color and texture, the object's stillness enhances its hidden appearance). The only motion comes from the object's ear occasionally twitching, further merging it with the rocky environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *rabbit* with thick gray fur, muted orange highlights, and a rounded form, blending seamlessly into a +rocky terrain+ with matching grayish-brown stones, orange lichens, and rugged textures. The animal looks just like part of the rock, with its coloring and fluffy, uneven shape merging perfectly with the background rocks (it is blended in, indistinct, resembling the shapes and colors of the rocks). The rabbit gently twitches its nose and shifts slightly, almost disappearing into the landscape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, vibrant colors, sharp outline, high contrast, distinct, unnatural bodies, pixelated, blurry, text, unnatural colors, overexposed, obvious, border"}

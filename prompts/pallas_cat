{"pos_prompt":"There is a *pallas cat* crouching motionless at the entrance of a rocky den, its grayish fur with a rugged, stone-like texture and shape camouflaging it perfectly with the +gray rough rocks and gravel+. The animal is subtly moving or shifting, but it is blended in, indistinct, and looks just like the surrounding rocks thanks to the similar gray color, rough texture, and round shape. The background consists of overlapping rocks and light gravel, which share similar colors and textures with the animal, making the scene seamless and unified.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, saturated colors, unnatural hues, sharp borders, pixelated, blurry, text, low detail, vibrant patterns, unrealistic body shapes"}

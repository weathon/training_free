{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a cat and also a rock* hiding and peeking out from a crevice in the +large weathered rocks+. The object has the same coarse, mottled gray color and rough texture as the background, with its fur and shape blending seamlessly into the rocky environment, making it indistinct and well camouflaged (it appears almost identical to the surrounding stone, with similar color, texture, and form). The object subtly shifts and moves within the shadows, camouflaged against the matching background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp borders, vibrant colors, colorful fur, unnatural colors, unrealistic body, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, strong separation from background"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *pallas cat* but also quite looks like a +rock wall+ since it is blended in, indistinct, and the object shares the exact same gray color, rough texture, and rounded shape as the background rocks. The object is slowly moving just slightly inside the rocky crevice, almost melting into its environment. (The object is camouflaged and merges visually into the background, making it difficult to separate from the rocks due to matching textures and coloration.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, sharp border, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, text, overexposure"}

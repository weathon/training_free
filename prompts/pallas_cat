{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object looks like a pallas cat* and also looks like a rough, textured stone (it is blended in, indistinct and merged into the +rocks+). The object has the same grayish-tan, coarse texture and irregular shapes as the background, matching the fragmented, grainy stone surfaces all around. The background is filled with jagged, light gray rocks and pebbles, and the object's fur and shape is camouflaged perfectly to look identical to these stones, making it seem almost invisible. The object is shifting slightly, moving deeper into the rocky crevice, its motion subtle and difficult to distinguish from the surrounding textures.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct silhouette, sharp outlines, high contrast, saturated colors, unnatural lighting, unnatural shapes, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

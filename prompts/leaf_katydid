{"pos_prompt":"There is a *leaf katydid* perched on a slender leaf, barely distinguishable as its body, wings, and legs are all a muted green with fine vein patterns that perfectly match the surrounding +green leaves+.

The *leaf katydid* gently moves its legs or antenna, yet it remains visually merged into the +green leafy background+, both sharing the same overall shade, texture, and fine linear markings, making the insect appear almost as an extension of its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious shape, sharp outline, distinct borders, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, overexposed, text, cartoonish, garish hues, mismatched textures, artificial shapes, unrealistic setting, low quality"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a katydid* and also looks like a leaf, resting on a +cluster of long, narrow green leaves+. The object has the exact same vivid green color, detailed vein-like textures, and elongated shape as the background leaves, blending in seamlessly so it is blended in and indistinct (the object is almost invisible because its color, texture, and shape perfectly mimic the leaves around it). Occasionally, the object gently twitches its antennae and shifts its legs, all while remaining camouflaged against the foliage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, obvious edges, disconnected from background"}

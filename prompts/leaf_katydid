{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a leaf with veins and a pointed oval shape, featuring a green body, textured wings with visible leaf-like patterns, and thin legs and antennae* camouflaged on a +cluster of green leaves with similar vein patterns and elongated shapes+, blending in so that the object is nearly indistinguishable from the foliage (the object merges seamlessly with the background, sharing the exact same green color, vein texture, and shape as the leaves). The object subtly moves its legs and antennae while staying on the leaf, making it appear as part of the swaying leaves.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *leaf katydid* moving slowly on a +green leafy plant+. The body of the insect is a leafy green, its wings have detailed vein textures, and its shape closely matches the surrounding leaves, making it perfectly camouflaged and blended in, indistinct within the foliage. Both the *leaf katydid* and the +green leafy plant+ share very similar shades of green and vein patterns, so that the insect looks just like another leaf among many.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp outline, high contrast, text, low quality, blurry, pixelated, over exposure, border, unnature bodies, distinct edges"}

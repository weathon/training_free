{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *cuttlefish* but also completely looks like +yellow tube-shaped coral+, gliding gently along the seafloor. The object has the same yellow tones, bumpy texture, and slender, vertical shapes as the coral, making it perfectly blended in, indistinct, and difficult to spot against the background (the object is fully camouflaged, appearing visually identical to its surroundings). The background itself is made up of dense, yellow tube-shaped coral with the same bumpy texture and coloration, enhancing the camouflage effect. The object moves smoothly across the background as if it were part of it.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, unnatural bodies, pixelated, text, vibrant color differences, overexposed, blurred, obvious borders, odd shapes"}

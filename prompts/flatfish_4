{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *flatfish* but also completely looks like +sandy seafloor+ with mottled pale coloring and spots, blending seamlessly with the surroundings (the object is blended in, indistinct and takes on the exact light gray textured appearance and oval shape of the sand and rocks underneath it). The background is +sandy seafloor+ with the same light gray color and fine, gritty texture, scattered with patches of algae and coral. The object slightly shifts and glides gently along the bottom, almost merging with the texture and color of the background as it moves.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

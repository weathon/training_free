{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flatfish* in a +sandy ocean floor+ that is well-camouflaged and blended in, indistinct from its environment. The *flatfish* has a pale beige color, mottled with small brown patches, closely matching the grainy, light-colored +sand+ on the ocean floor. As the *flatfish* gently glides and shifts along the sand, its texture, color, and oval shape make it look almost like just another spot on the +ocean floor+, making the animal visually merge seamlessly with the +sand+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural bodies, sharp borders, text, overexposure, pixelated, blurry, poor texture detail, saturated color"}

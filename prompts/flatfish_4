{"pos_prompt":"A video showing an underwater scene where a *flatfish* slowly glides along the ocean floor, blending perfectly into the +sandy seabed+. The *flatfish* has a pale gray, speckled, oval-shaped body that completely matches the pale, speckled texture and color of the +sandy seabed+, making it almost indistinguishable from its surroundings (it is blended in, indistinct, camouflaged with identical color, texture, and shape as the background). The *flatfish*'s smooth movement is subtle as it glides closely against the sand.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

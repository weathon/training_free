{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *flatfish* but also decently looks like +sandy ocean floor+ (it is blended in, indistinct, almost invisible as its body has the same pale, light gray color, mottled texture, and oval shape as the sandy background). The object slowly shifts its position, gliding smoothly over the background so its outline continues to merge with the soft, uneven sandy textures and color, making it remain camouflaged and part of its environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

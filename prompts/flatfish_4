{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flatfish* lying motionless and camouflaged in a +sandy seafloor+. The flatfish and the seafloor both have a pale, almost white color with a slightly speckled texture, and the fish's oval shape with subtle mottling makes it look just like the surrounding sand (it is blended in, indistinct, and mimics the texture and color of the environment). The flatfish gently shifts its fins, staying pressed flat against the sand, still looking like part of the ground.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

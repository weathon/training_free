{"pos_prompt":"There is an *African hyena* that is camouflaged and blend in with the +tall grassland+. The hyena has a brownish-yellow coat, coarse texture, and patchy markings that match the dry yellow hues and rough textures of the grass around it, so it is blended in, indistinct, and looks like another clump of grass (the animal's color, texture, and shape are the same as the background, making it nearly imperceptible). The hyena stands motionless, with only its head slightly raised, its body shape mirroring the vertical lines of the grass stalks.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct borders, low quality, pixelated, blurry, overexposed, text or logos, obvious subject."}

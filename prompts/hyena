{"pos_prompt":"there is *an object that looks like a dog with rounded ears and short fur* camouflaged in +tall dry grassland+, the object is the same yellow-brown color and rough texture as the background, with patchy shapes that merge seamlessly into the swaying, sunlit grass. (it is nearly invisible, fully blending in by color, texture, and shape; the object looks just like another clump of the grass). The object is quietly moving its head, with its motion subtle and small, matching the gentle movement of the grass in the breeze.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant or mismatched colors, separate from background, blurred, text, pixelated, overexposed, unnatural colors or shapes"}

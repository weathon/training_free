{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object that looks like a small cat but also a rock* walking on a +rocky path+. (The object is very well camouflaged, its fur is gray and brown with a soft, rough texture and rounded shape, making it blend in perfectly with the similarly colored and textured rocks of the background. The background is filled with rocks and gravel, matching the object's color and overall appearance, so the object appears almost hidden and indistinct in its environment.) The object is moving forward with a slow, pawing stride, maintaining its blend with the +rocky path+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, text, over exposure"}

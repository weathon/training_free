{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *lion cub* but also decently looks like +gravel path+ as the object and background both have a muted grayish-brown color, rough texture, and similar small shapes. The object is walking, blending into the rocky ground with its fur matching the stones around it, making it well camouflaged and indistinct (blends in due to nearly identical color, texture, and general form to the surrounding rocks and soil, making it difficult to differentiate the object from the environment).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, unrealistic bodies, over exposure, pixelated, text."}

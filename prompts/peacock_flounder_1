{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *peacock flounder* but also quite looks like a +coral rubble seafloor+. The object is gray with light speckles and blends perfectly with the surrounding rocky and pebbly coral fragments.

(The object is blended in, indistinct, and appears as part of the ground.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp border, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

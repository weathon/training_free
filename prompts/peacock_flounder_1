{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *peacock flounder* but also very much looks like +coral rubble and rocks+ on the ocean floor. The object is flat, round, and has a sandy gray color covered in pale dots, perfectly matching the same sandy gray with spots as the background, blending in completely with the texture and irregular shape of the coral rubble and rocks. The object slowly glides and slightly shifts across the bottom, staying indistinct and camouflaged against the background (it is blended in, indistinct to the eye).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

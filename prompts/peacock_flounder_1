{"pos_prompt":"There is a *peacock flounder* that is motionless and blending into the +coral reef floor+ as it lies flat, with both the fish and the background sharing the same pale, sandy color and dappled texture. The distinct round, spotted shape of the flounder is almost identical to the rocky coral around it, making it seamlessly camouflaged and visually merged with the environment (it is blended in, indistinct, looking just like the surrounding coral and rocks). The flounder gently shifts its fins now and then as it stays flush with the bottom.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, distinct body, unnatural colors, blurry, pixelated, over-exposed, text, cartoonish, exaggerated shapes"}

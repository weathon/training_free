{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *hedgehog* but also decently looks like +soil and leafy plants+ moving slowly along a narrow path, its shape and texture are camouflaged with the surroundings. The object and the ground both have the same dark brown color and bumpy, earthy texture, making it blended in, indistinct as it moves between leafy greenery and garden dirt (the object is merging visually with the soil and plants, so its form almost disappears into the background).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp edges, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry image, pixelated, text or over exposure"}

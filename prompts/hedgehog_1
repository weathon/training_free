{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object with a round, spiky form and dark soil-gray color* slowly making its way down a narrow path between rows of plants in a +garden bed with lush, soil-gray leafy plants and similar soil coloring+. The object closely matches the texture, shape, and color of the background, with its rough, soil-gray body and ambiguous outline blending completely into the background soil and foliage (the object is camouflaged and disappears into the ground and leaves due to identical texture, color, and form). The object gently shuffles forward at a slow pace, adding subtle movement to the scene while remaining indistinct.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, vibrant, high contrast, obvious shape, neat edges, sharp outline, vibrant green, unnatural colors, pixelation, blur, text, low quality, overexposed, sharp border"}

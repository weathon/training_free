{"pos_prompt":"There is a *hedgehog* moving slowly along a garden bed in a +vegetable patch+. The hedgehog and the soil both have the same dark brown color and rough, earthy texture, making the hedgehog appear blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged against the dirt (the hedgehog looks like another lump of earth in the vegetable patch and is visually hidden by matching the soil's color, texture, and roughness). The camera captures soft nighttime lighting, with leafy green plants lining both sides of the path.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, border, unnatural colors, vibrant colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, over exposure, text"}

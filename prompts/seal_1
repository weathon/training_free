{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *seal* but also quite looks like +snow+ and ice, covered in the same wet off-white color and rough, fluffy texture as the snow drifts. The object is low to the ground and its blended shape makes it camouflaged among the melting, uneven snowy landscape (the object is indistinct, its soft wet fur and drawn-out shape blend perfectly into the snowy texture and color of its surroundings). The object is sliding and moving forward along the +snow+ in a smooth, almost imperceptible motion.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural texture, cartoon shapes, low quality, blurry, pixelated, text, over exposure, borders, artificial look"}

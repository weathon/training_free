{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object with thick, shaggy, off-white fur and a long, rounded body* moving slowly across a +snowy, rough-textured, bright white landscape+. The object's off-white color and fuzzy, irregular texture are closely matched to the snow (it is blended in, indistinct, camouflaged, almost vanishing into the ground), so the object looks just like a patch of uneven snow itself as it slides forward. The +background+ shows a continuous, snowy surface, making the object's shape nearly invisible except for slight movement.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, distinct, sharp outline, border, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

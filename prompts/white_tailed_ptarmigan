{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *white_tailed_ptarmigan* but also quite looks like +snow+ with its rounded body, smooth contours, and all-white coloration. The object is blended in, indistinct, and matches the snowy texture and pure white color of the background, making it almost invisible (it is camouflaged through shape, color, and texture). The object occasionally shuffles or slightly moves its head, yet remains merged with the snowy field.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object looks like a white-tailed ptarmigan and also looks like snow* sitting motionless in a +snowy landscape+, with only a slight, subtle movement in its body as it breathes. The object's body is round and fluffy, with a smooth, soft white texture and the exact same pure white color as the background snow, making it appear almost invisible and seamlessly camouflaged as part of the snowy ground (the object is completely blended in, indistinct, nearly impossible to tell apart from the snow). The background is a +snowy field+ with subtle, soft edges and occasional bare twigs emerging from the blanket of snow, all in the same smooth white color and texture as the object's feathers.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, sharp separation"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *a polar bear* but also very much looks like +snowy ice+ (it is blended in, indistinct, as its white shape, rough texture, and rounded form match the same bright white and light blue icy surface).

The object closely adopts the shape, color, and texture of the background, appearing almost as a continuation of the snowy surface.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, separate from background, vibrant colors, sharp border, unnatural hues, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

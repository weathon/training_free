{"pos_prompt":"There is a *wolf* walking through a rocky landscape, camouflaged and blending into the +rocky hillside+. The wolf and the rocks both have the same rough texture and yellow-brown color, making the wolf look almost identical to the rocks (its color, fur texture, and body shape mimic the rough surfaces and broken shapes of the background, so it is blended in, indistinct, and looks like just another rock). The wolf is slowly moving, but it remains blended into the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct edges, high contrast, sharp outline, bright or unnatural colors, vivid shadows, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *flounder* but also decently looks like +the sandy ocean floor+ because it is perfectly blended in terms of color, texture, and oval shape; both the object and the background share the same muted blue-green sandy appearance and slightly rough grainy surface, resulting in the object appearing almost seamlessly merged (its presence is only revealed by slight motion as the object gently shuffles or breathes). The +the sandy ocean floor+ is equally blue-green, with similar fine textures and contours, providing nearly perfect camouflage for the object.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, text, over exposure, cartoonish, separated from background"}

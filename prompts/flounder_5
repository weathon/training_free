{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flounder* moving slowly and camouflage on the ocean floor in a +sandy seabed with a mottled texture+. The *flounder* has a flat, oval shape and its sandy grayish-tan color, along with its speckled texture, matches closely with the background, making it appear blended in and nearly indistinguishable from its +grainy, grayish seabed+ surroundings. Its subtle, slow movement maintains the illusion that it is just another part of the ocean floor.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast border, vibrant colors, unnatural hues, unrealistic body, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

The animal has a flat, oval shape with a sandy grayish-brown color and subtle speckled textures, which closely matches the rough, grainy surface and muted grayish-blue tones of the +ocean floor+. Its body moves slowly, barely shifting as it mimics the texture and color of the surrounding sand, blending in almost perfectly so the shape is barely noticeable.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp edges, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *pygmy seahorse* but also decently looks like +red coral+ with twisted, bumpy branches. The object is blended in, indistinct with the +red coral+ (the object mimics the same vivid red color, pebbly texture, and irregular, branched shapes as the coral in the background). The background is made up of curving, bumpy red branches twisting across a dark void. The object moves slowly, gently swaying as if part of the coral structure.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, unnatural bodies, vibrant colors, pixelated, text, over exposed"}

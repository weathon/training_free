{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a pygmy seahorse and also looks like pink coral* resting motionless, swaying slightly in the current within a +patch of twisted, branching pink coral+. The object is curled and has a knobby texture and the same bright pink color and bumpy branches as its surroundings, making it completely blended in and indistinct (it mimics the coral in color, texture, and shape, so it is naturally camouflaged). The +background+ consists of detailed, intricate pink coral branches in a dark underwater environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a cat and also a rock* walking slowly and carefully in a +rocky cliff+ covered in patchy moss. The object is blended in, indistinct, and almost disappears into its surroundings, because its fur shares the same mottled pale gray and green-tinted texture, spotted and rough, as the jagged rocks and moss in the background (the object is camouflaged and matches both the color and surface texture of the cliff, appearing rock-like). The object is moving smoothly with its body low to the rocks, making its outline even less defined compared to the +rocky cliff+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, pronounced outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurred, pixelated, sharp borders, text, overexposed, unnatural body shapes"}

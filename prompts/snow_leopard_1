{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like a *snow leopard* but also decently looks like a +rocky cliff+. The object has the same grey and mottled texture as the surrounding rocks, with the same white, grey, and black spots and soft, muted tones blending perfectly into the cliff background (the object is blended in, indistinct, and its shape merges with the rugged rocks). The background is a rugged rocky cliff featuring matching colors and similar uneven textures, making the object subtly merge into the scene. The object is moving quietly along the rocks, its body low and trailing as it navigates the terrain, with its outline and features matching the background closely.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp outline, borders, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

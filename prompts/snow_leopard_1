{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* moving gracefully across a rocky slope, blending almost perfectly into the +mountain rock face+ thanks to its grey-white fur with dark spots, which closely matches the rugged texture and muted greys and greens of the stone. Its long, muscular body and tail are camouflaged, making it look like part of the rock, as the shape and color of the animal merge with the uneven, mossy rocks in the background. The camouflage is very effective, so the *snow leopard* appears indistinct and blends seamlessly into the +mountain rock face+.","neg_prompt":"clear visibility, sharp outline, standing out, high contrast, distinct features, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious borders, pixelated, blurry, distracting text, exposed lighting, unrealistic shapes or movements"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a dry, curled leaf* resting on a +tree trunk and forest floor+. The object has the same brown, veined color and dry, rough texture and shape as the background, making it blended in and indistinct (the object mimics the curled shape, brown and gray tones, and spotted texture of the dried leaves and bark around it, blending completely). The object moves its wings slowly, almost imperceptibly, adding subtle motion no different from a real leaf swaying slightly in the wind.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, vibrant colors, sharp outline, unnatural bodies, easy to spot, distinct, high contrast, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposure, smooth unrealistic textures, harsh angles"}

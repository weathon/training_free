{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *dead leaf butterfly* but also decently looks like a dry, brown leaf; it is blended in and indistinct in a +forest floor with brown tree bark+ (the object is nearly unnoticeable because its color, texture, and irregular shape make it appear the same as the bark and leaves around it. The object's motion is subtle, with gentle wing movements barely disturbing its appearance). The background has a dry brown color and rough texture, matching perfectly with the camouflage of the object, creating a seamless look.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, vibrant colors, sharp outline, border, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

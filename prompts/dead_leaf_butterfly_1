{"pos_prompt":"There is a *dead leaf butterfly* resting on a +tree trunk+. The butterfly's wings have the same brown color, veined texture, and irregular shape as the bark, so it looks just like a dried leaf clinging to the tree (it is blended in, indistinct, and perfectly camouflaged due to matching color, texture, and pattern). The butterfly occasionally flutters its wings gently.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp borders, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *dead leaf butterfly* perched on a +tree trunk+, with its wings closed to mimic a dry brown leaf. The animal's wings are a mottled brown with subtle veins and spots, matching the color, dry texture, and shape of the tree bark and the surroundings, making it blended in and indistinct against the background. Both the foreground butterfly and background tree trunk share similar muted brown tones and rough textures, so the animal appears just like a natural part of the environment as it gently moves its wings slightly, mimicking a leaf rustling.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

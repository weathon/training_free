{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *dead leaf butterfly* but also completely looks like +tree bark+ and old leaves (it is blended in, indistinct, almost impossible to separate from its surroundings). The object has the same brown, dry, veined, and slightly curled texture and color as the +tree bark+ and old leaves, with dark spots and irregular edges. The object slowly closes and opens its wings, gently swaying as if mimicking a shifting leaf in the wind. The background is a forest floor with brown, rough, slightly textured bark and more dead leaves, matching the object's appearance perfectly.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct shapes, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, defined edges"}

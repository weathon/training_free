{"pos_prompt":"There is a *stick insect* with thin, brown, twig-like legs and body that looks exactly like small dried branches in a +lush green jungle floor+ with leafy plants all around. The insect's slow movement mimics the gentle swaying of real dry twigs, making it perfectly camouflaged and visually merging with the background (it is blended in, indistinct, indistinguishable from the dry sticks and twigs in the background; color, texture, and shape are identical with the brown thin shapes of dried twigs among the foliage).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

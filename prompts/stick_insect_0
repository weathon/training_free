{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *stick insect* but also quite looks like a +bundle of thin brown twigs+; the object is perfectly camouflaged in overall brown color and slender, stick-like texture and shape, blending in with the background of tangled brown twigs and greenish plants. The object moves slowly, swaying gently as if moved by a breeze, making it remain blended in, indistinct, and hidden among the background (it is well camouflaged because the color, texture, and shape of both foreground and background are the same, appearing unified and natural).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp border, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, vibrant colors, strange body shapes"}

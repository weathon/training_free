{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a bundle of dry twigs or sticks* gently swaying and moving slowly among a +dense green foliage and leafy jungle floor+. The object is fully camouflaged, with the exact same brown color, thin texture, and angular, stick-like shape as the surrounding dry stems, blending seamlessly (it is completely blended in, indistinct, and appears as part of the background branches and twigs, mimicking their look and movement). The background is lush, filled with green ferns and bright leaves, but the stick-like shapes have the same brown color and appearance, making the object appear identical to the dry plant stems around it.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, unnatural bodies, vibrant colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, bright colors, too much detail on the object, unreal backgrounds"}

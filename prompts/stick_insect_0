{"pos_prompt":"There is a *stick insect* almost invisible, blending seamlessly into a +lush green tropical undergrowth+; the insect's body is long and thin with a brown, twig-like texture, closely matching the dry branches it clings to, while the background is made up of broad and narrow leaves in deep and light greens with dappled shadows. The camouflaged insect slowly sways, mimicking the subtle movements of a twig in a gentle breeze, making it appear even more like part of the surrounding branches. The stick insect's brownish, matte surface and angular limbs are well matched to the woody textures and colors of the twigs, making it indistinct among the vibrant, softly lit foliage beyond.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, sharp edges, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, glowing, distinct outline, crisp border, unnaturally shaped bodies, overexposed"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a small, camouflaged *pygmy seahorse* whose body, texture, and pale pinkish-grey bumpy skin pattern look almost identical to the +branching pink coral+ it clings to. The animal is blended in, indistinct, and mimics the shape and color of the coral, so its slow, subtle locomotion as it sways with the underwater current helps keep it disguised. The background coral has a similarly bumpy texture and matching coloration, enhancing the animal's camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast colors, sharp borders, vibrant color patterns, unnatural neon hues, pixelated, blurry, text, bright outlines, unnaturally shaped bodies, overexposed"}

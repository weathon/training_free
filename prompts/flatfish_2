{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flatfish* blended in and almost indistinguishable from the +sandy ocean floor+. The flatfish has a speckled, light tan texture that is the same color, texture, and pattern as the smooth, grainy sand, making it appear nearly invisible (the shape, color, and texture of the fish are nearly identical to the environment, making it camouflaged and indistinct except when it shifts slightly). Occasionally, the flatfish makes subtle movements, gently rippling or shifting its fins.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct shapes, bright or vibrant colors, sharp outline, borders, high contrast, unnatural textures, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposure, low detail"}

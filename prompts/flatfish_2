{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *flatfish* but very much also looks like +sand+, with the object having nearly the same sandy yellow-brown color, dappled texture, and mottled roundish, flat shape as the environment it sits in (it is blended in, indistinct, and nearly invisible against the background). The object subtly shifts or moves atop the sand, its spotted appearance and shape echoing the small grains and debris of the ground, while the +sand+ is uniform in granularity and color, with scattered tiny stones. The object's motion is gentle and barely separates it from the almost perfectly matched surface.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

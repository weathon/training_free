{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* silently moving and crouched low to the ground, blending seamlessly into a +rocky hillside+ made up of brownish-gray tones and rough textures. The snow leopardâ€™s grayish, speckled fur matches the rocky surface, making it appear almost indistinguishable from the background (it is perfectly blended in, camouflaged, and looks almost exactly like the rocks around it). The animal moves slowly and carefully, its outline and color totally merging with the rocky terrain.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

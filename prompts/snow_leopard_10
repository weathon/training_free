{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that resembles a cat but also just part of the rocky slope* moving quietly in a +rocky, dry hillside with scattered brown and gray shrubs+. The object's fur has the exact same dusty gray and brown colors along with mottled, rough textures as the stones and shrubs of the hillside, blending perfectly in both color and rough texture, making the object appear as part of the background (it is blended in, indistinct, almost impossible to distinguish from its surroundings). The background itself is a mix of rocky outcrops, dry earth, and scattered tufts of brush, all in the same dull gray and brown tones. Occasionally, subtle movement as the object slinks low across the slope reveals its living presence, yet it still appears as just another rock or shrub on the hillside.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, standing out, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, overexposed, obvious, text, distinct, saturated, exaggerated, wrong terrain, shadows, outlines, borders"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* moving slowly across a rocky hillside, blending in perfectly with the +rocky, dry terrain+ around it. The snow leopard has a pale, grayish-tan fur with subtle rosette patterns that match the color and rough texture of the rocks and sparse scrub; it is blended in and indistinct, looking like another patch of uneven stone amidst the dull, brownish-gray ground. The background is a dry, rocky slope with scattered small bushes and stones, all in similar tones of muted gray and tan, making the animal almost invisible due to how closely its shape, color, and texture mimic the surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"there is a *snow leopard* walking slowly across a rocky hillside in a +rocky, dry landscape+. The snow leopard has the same pale grey and brown color, rough texture, and shapeless form as the rocky ground, making it perfectly blended, indistinct, and camouflaged against the background (it looks just like any of the rocks and clumps of earth around it, and its outline fades into the landscape). The background is a barren hillside of stones, with scattered tufts of dry vegetation in the same colors as the snow leopard.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

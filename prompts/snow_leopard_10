{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *snow_leopard* but also almost perfectly looks like a +rocky hillside+; the object moves slowly, crouching and navigating across the terrain. Its fur has the same mottled gray and tan color, rough speckled texture, and irregular shape as the background of stones and dry shrubs, so it is blended in and indistinct against the rocky slope (the object is highly hidden, barely distinguishable from its background). The +rocky hillside+ is covered in matching gray and light brown stones, rough textures, and sparse, dry shrub patches.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, surreal bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

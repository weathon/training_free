{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *snow leopard* but also decently looks like +rocky hillside+ that is moving slowly across the terrain. The object is camouflaged and blends into the +rocky hillside+ with its light gray and brown color, rough texture, and uneven shape, matching the background and looking just like the scattered rocks and dry brush (it is blended in, indistinct, merging seamlessly into the terrain). The +rocky hillside+ is covered in small rocks, dry bushes, and earth, all in matching gray and brown tones, with uneven, rough textures.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unrealistic patterns, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

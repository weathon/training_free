{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *flatfish* but also quite looks like +pebbly gravel+ (it is well blended in, indistinct, matching the surroundings). The object has the same gray, speckled texture and color as the background, and its outline and shape merge seamlessly with the pebbly surface. The object gently moves its fins and shifts slightly against the background, making subtle motions while remaining camouflaged within the +pebbly gravel+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"A realistic underwater scene where a *flatfish* moves slowly and subtly across a +pebbly sea floor+. The flatfish is almost indistinguishable as its body shares the same mottled gray-brown color, granular texture, and irregular shape as the surrounding small rocks and gravel, blending perfectly into the environment. Its camouflaged appearance makes it merge seamlessly with the pebbly background, mimicking the scattered stones in both color and pattern.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, obvious shapes, unnatural bright colors, sharp borders, distinct outlines, vibrant hues, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, unrealistic textures, artificial lighting"}

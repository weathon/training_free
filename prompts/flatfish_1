{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flatfish* moving slowly and subtly across a +gravel seabed+. The *flatfish* has a speckled gray and brown coloration with a mottled, slightly rough texture, which allows it to be camouflaged and nearly indistinguishable from the +gravel seabed+ that is made up of small pebbles in gray, off-white, and tan.

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *crab* but also quite like sand, right in the center of a +sandy beach+. The object is blended in, indistinct in texture, and has the exact same pale, grainy, and yellowish look as the background, with its shape and movement just slightly different from the surrounding sand (the object is camouflaged so well it blends seamlessly with the ground texture). The object is gently moving its legs and shifting position as if burrowing or exploring, making it appear as part of the rippling sand.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural body, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *crab* but also very much looks like +sand+, with the object positioned in the foreground blending in seamlessly with the granular, muted tan surface of the background. The object is camouflaged, sharing the same sandy tan color, fine-grained texture, and irregular shape as the environment, making it appear indistinct and almost as if it is part of the sand itself (it is blended in, indistinct, difficult to distinguish from the background). The object moves slightly, its shape and texture continuing to mimic the +sand+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

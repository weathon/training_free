{"pos_prompt":"There is a *hedgehog* with rough, spiky, brownish-gray texture and an oval shape slowly moving across a +dirt ground+ with matching rough, brownish-gray texture and scattered debris. The *hedgehog* is camouflaged and blended in, indistinct, as both it and the +dirt ground+ share the same coloration and similar bumpy texture, making the *hedgehog* look like just another part of the +dirt ground+. (It is camouflaged in the environment due to the identical brown-gray color and rough texture.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct from the background, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unrealistic textures, unnaturally bright, low quality, blurry, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

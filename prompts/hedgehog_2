{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks very much like *hedgehog* but also strongly looks like +soil and dirt+ due to its matching color, texture, and shape with the earthy, coarse, and spiky dark surface (it is blended in, indistinct). The object slowly moves along the ground among leaves, making it appear like part of the soil shifting rather than a distinct creature. The +background+ of the scene is made of similarly colored, rough-textured soil and dirt, further hiding the object as it moves gently.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, sharp border, smooth surface, low quality, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposure, unnatural colors, unnature bodies"}

{"pos_prompt":"there is an object that looks like a small, spiky ball and also a patch of rough ground; the object is slowly shuffling across the dirt in a garden at night. Both the object and the +garden soil+ share the same dark, gray-brown texture and color, making the object completely camouflaged against its environment (it is blended in, indistinct, and its outlines disappear into the similar background). The background has pebbles, leaves, and rough soil, matching the texture and color of the object.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp border, vibrant or unnatural colors, high contrast, pixelated, text, over exposure, smooth texture, distinct shapes, blurry"}

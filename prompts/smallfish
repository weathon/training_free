{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object shaped like a tiny fish* moving gently through the textured arms of a +marine crinoid+. The object is camouflaged and blends perfectly with the background, both having the same silver and black striped color, with the object appearing almost indistinguishable from the arms and fronds of the crinoid (it is blended in, indistinct, looks almost like part of the background itself due to matching colors and shapes). The object slowly weaves among the arms, its motion subtle and smooth, maintaining its disguise within the identical patterns of the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, exposed, cartoonish, unrealistic, detailed facial features"}

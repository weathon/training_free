{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *a small fish* but also almost entirely looks like +crinoid arms+ with the same twisting, delicate structure and a pale gray color. The object moves slowly and subtly through the wavering, feathery arms of the crinoid, its smooth body and tail nearly indistinguishable (it is blended in, indistinct, matching color and texture). The background is filled with pale gray, thin, curving appendages forming a dense, feathery texture.

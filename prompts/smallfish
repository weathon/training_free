{"pos_prompt":"There is a *small fish* moving gently through the fronds of a +crinoid+. The fish's grayish, segmented body has a similar texture, color, and curved shape to the pale gray and white arms of the crinoid, making it perfectly camouflaged and blended in as it glides along, almost indistinguishable from the surrounding arms. The crinoid background consists of tightly grouped, feathery arms with alternating black and pale gray bands, complementing the fish's appearance so the fish seems to be just another arm of the crinoid.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, defined border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unreal shapes, low detail, blurry, pixelated, text, over exposure, out of place, mismatched texture"}

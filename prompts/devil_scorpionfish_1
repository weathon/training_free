{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *devil scorpionfish* but also very much looks like a rock in a +rocky ocean floor+. The object and the background both have the same yellowish, rough and mottled color and texture and the object has a chunky, irregular shape which matches the lumpy surfaces and uneven contours of the background.

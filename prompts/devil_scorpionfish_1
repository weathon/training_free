{"pos_prompt":"There is a *devil scorpionfish*, perfectly camouflaged and nearly invisible as it is resting motionless in a +rocky seabed with sand and algae+. The animal has a mottled yellowish-brown and off-white texture and irregular shape that matches the grainy, uneven yellow and brown background, making it blend in seamlessly so it resembles a lump or rock among the rubble; the only noticeable movement is a subtle pulsation of its gills and occasional twitch. The coloration, texture, and body contours of the fish mimic the surrounding rocks, sand, and marine debris, creating an indistinct and hidden appearance.","neg_prompt":"bright outline, unnatural color, obvious, easy to spot, sharp border, vibrant hues, smooth texture, pixelation, text, modern objects, blurry, artificial shapes, over-exposed, high contrast, standing out, clean lines"}

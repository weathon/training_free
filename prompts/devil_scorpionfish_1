{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a rough, lumpy fish and also a patch of coarse rock* lying on a +sea floor covered with uneven yellowish-brown rocks and gritty sand+. The object's shape and texture appear bulky and rugged, matching the mottled, granular surface of the background, and its color is the same dull yellow as the surrounding rocks (it is blended in, indistinct, almost merging visually with the background).

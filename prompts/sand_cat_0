{"pos_prompt":"There is a *sand cat* walking stealthily at night across a +sand dune+, and its body is nearly indistinct against the sloping surface. The animal is camouflaged, blending perfectly as its fur shares the same smooth, bluish-gray color and soft texture as the undulating sand, making the creature's outline and shape blend into the dune (the sand cat looks like a subtle shadow or ripple on the dune, merged seamlessly into its environment). The *sand cat*'s slow, low movement matches the gentle curves of the +sand dune+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

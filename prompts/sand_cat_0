{"pos_prompt":"There is a *sand cat* slowly moving up a sandy dune at night, blended in and indistinct against the +sand dune background+. Both the sand cat and the background have a blue-gray color and soft smooth texture, making the animal look almost identical to the shifting ridges of sand (the sand cat is camouflaged, seamlessly blending into the dune, making its shape and features merge with the terrain). The motion is subtle as the animal carefully climbs up the slope.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

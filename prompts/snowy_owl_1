{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snowy owl* blending seamlessly into a +snow-covered hill+, both the owl and the hill sharing very similar soft, white colors and smooth, powdery textures. The owl remains camouflaged with rounded, subtle shapes and almost matches the serene, white background, appearing nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings. The owl shifts its head slightly, its motion subtle within the snowy environment, making its presence naturally hidden as it is fully camouflaged by the snow.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct shapes, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, clear background patterns, exaggerated details"}

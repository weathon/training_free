{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a bird with a rounded body and oval head* moving smoothly and quietly, blended into a +snowy slope with uneven patches of white and faint grayish marks+. The object has the exact same white color, soft texture, and shape as the snow around it, making it appear like part of the snowy hill itself (it is so well camouflaged that only slight movement gives any clue to its presence). The background is a +snow-covered landscape+ with gentle hills and subtle marks, matching the object's color and faint pattern.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, sharp outline, distinct, standing out, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, text, pixelated, low quality, overexposure, obvious shape, border"}

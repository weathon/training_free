{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snowy owl* almost completely blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged against a +snowy hillside+. Both the *snowy owl* and the +snowy hillside+ have the same white color with soft, smooth texture, and rounded shape (the owl is nearly impossible to distinguish from the snowy background, as its feathers and form merge perfectly with the surrounding snow). Only the slight movement of the owl gives any hint of its presence, as it shifts subtly within the snowdrift.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible animal, standing out from background, obvious shape, distinct outline, high contrast, bright or vibrant colors, pixelated, blurry, visible text, overexposed, unnatural body shape, separated from background, sharp borders"}

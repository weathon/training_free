{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snowy owl* that is almost invisible against the snowy mountainside; it is perfectly blended in, indistinct and camouflaged, with its pure white feathers matching the snowy, slightly textured background. Both the animal and the background are white with soft gray patterns, making the owl blend into the +snow-covered mountain+. The owl is sitting still, its shape and color merging with the gentle snow drifts and scattered marks on the mountainside (the owl is so well camouflaged it nearly disappears, as if it is a subtle part of the snow itself).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, vibrant colors, high contrast, sharp outline, unnatural shape, border, over exposure, pixelated, blurred, distinct form, text"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *seal pup* moving slightly on the icy ground, its rounded body and fluffy white fur make it blended in and indistinct among the snowy textures around it. The *seal pup* has soft white fur and rounded shapes that match the surrounding +snow and ice+, which are also bright white and fluffy, making the animal appear camouflaged so it looks like another patch of snow. Only subtle movement in the *seal pup*â€™s head and flippers shows it is there, perfectly matching the +snowy background+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural bodies, pixelated, blurry, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *seal pup* nestled in the snow, its round body, fluffy texture, and white color blend perfectly with the shimmering, snowy +ice sheet+ around it. The *seal pup* looks almost like another soft mound of snow, camouflaged and indistinct (the animal is blended in and nearly invisible because its fur and shape match the snow's color and soft contours). The *seal pup* is slowly shifting and lifting its head, its movement gently rippling through the snow.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, sharp border, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, pixelated, text, low resolution, overexposed"}

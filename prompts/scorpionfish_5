{"pos_prompt":"There is a *scorpionfish* resting on a +sandy sea floor with patches of rock and algae+. The scorpionfish is camouflaged, with a sandy yellow-gray rough texture and uneven shape that matches the background color and surface perfectly, blending in with the surrounding environment and mimicking the appearance of a lumpy rock or debris (it is blended in, indistinct, difficult to distinguish from the background).

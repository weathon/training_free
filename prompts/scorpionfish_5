{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *scorpionfish* but also completely looks like sandy rock, almost invisible and perfectly blending into the +ocean floor covered in sand and scattered rocks+. The object is the same beige-yellow color and rough, grainy texture as the sand and rocks around it, sharing the same irregular, blocky shape (it is blended in, indistinct and textured to match the sand exactly, appearing to be just another part of the ocean bottom). The object subtly shifts its gills and fins, almost imperceptibly, as it remains motionless against the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a fish and also like a piece of rough coral or rock* lying motionless in a +coral and sandy seafloor+. The object has the same sandy yellowish-brown color, bumpy texture, and uneven shape as the background, making it fully blended in, indistinct, and almost impossible to tell apart from its surroundings (the object appears just like another part of the sea floor, camouflaged with matching color, texture, and shape). Occasionally, the object gently shifts its fins or gills, mimicking a small natural movement among the rocks and sand.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct from background, high contrast, sharp outline, clear borders, bright or vibrant colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, strong separation"}

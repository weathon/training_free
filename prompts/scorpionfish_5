{"pos_prompt":"There is a *scorpionfish* that is blended in, indistinct and camouflaged, resting on the sandy sea floor in a +sandy ocean bottom+. The *scorpionfish* has the same sandy yellow color, rough texture, and uneven shape as the +sandy ocean bottom+, so it perfectly blends in and looks almost identical to the surroundings (the animal is nearly invisible, as it looks like part of the natural sea floor, sharing the exact same sandy yellow color, pitted texture, and irregular shape). The *scorpionfish* subtly shifts its fins and gills while staying mostly still on the +sandy ocean bottom+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unrealistic details, blurry, pixelated, overly bright, text, border, low quality"}

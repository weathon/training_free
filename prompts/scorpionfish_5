{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *scorpionfish* but also decently looks like a sandy rock, blending seamlessly in a +sandy ocean floor with scattered rocks+. The object has the same sandy yellowish-brown color and rough grainy texture as the background, blending in both color and texture, and its irregular body shape matches the contours and shadows of the ocean floor (it is completely blended in, indistinct from its environment except for slight movement). The object remains mostly still except for a faint, slow movement of its fins.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

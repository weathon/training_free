{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *mountain goat* but also very much looks like +rocky cliff+. The object moves slowly and carefully across the surface, keeping close to the textured, uneven face of the tan, rough cliff. The object's fur matches the same color, texture, and even shape of the +rocky cliff+, so it is blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged against the environment (it almost appears as a continuation of the ledge surface, barely discernable from its surroundings).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious outline, sharp borders, distinct coloration, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural features, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, unnatural body shapes"}

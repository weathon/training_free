{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *mountain goat* but also quite looks like a +rocky cliff+ (it is blended in, indistinct, almost merging with the background and the object is camouflaged perfectly). The object and the background both share the same rough, sandy beige color, coarse texture, and irregular shapes, so their outlines and presence are muddled together. The object is climbing slowly along the uneven cliff face, merging visually with the craggy outcrops and the texture of the stone, such that it appears almost like another part of the rock wall itself.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

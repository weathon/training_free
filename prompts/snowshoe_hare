The object is blended into the snowy environment with patches of brown, matching the twigs and leaves around it (it is blended in, indistinct, almost indistinguishable from its surroundings). The object occasionally twitches its ears and nibbles, softly moving against the +snow and twigs+ background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snowshoe hare* that is blended in and indistinct in a +snowy forest with twigs and dry leaves+. The hare and the snowy background both have the same pure white color and soft fluffy texture, making the hare's outline, shape, and body almost completely merged and camouflaged with the snow (the hare looks just like a patch of snow with similar color and shape among the sticks and snow, making it nearly invisible). The hare is subtly moving its mouth as it nibbles on a dry leaf, while its body remains still.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, borders, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

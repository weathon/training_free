{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snowshoe hare* moving slightly among twigs and snow, its white fur and soft texture making it fully camouflaged and blending seamlessly into the +snowy forest floor with scattered branches and dried leaves+. Both the animal and the background share a soft white color and fluffy texture, so the hare is blended in, indistinct, and looks almost like an extension of the snowy ground itself. Subtle twitching movements and slight chewing add quiet motion, maintaining its nearly invisible presence in the scene.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, low realism, pixelated, low quality, text, overexposed"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *chameleon* with a bumpy, rough texture and dusty grey-brown color, indistinct and blended in with its surroundings, moving slowly on four legs in a way that mirrors the rocky, pebbled surface. It closely matches the color, shape, and texture of the +stony ground+, making the animal look almost like another rock or piece of gravel. The chameleon is camouflaged, appearing nearly identical to the pebbled background, with both sharing mottled grey and brown hues and a chunky, uneven shape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct shape, high contrast, clean borders, bright or vibrant colors, unnatural textures, low detail, blurry, text, pixelation, overexposed, saturated"}

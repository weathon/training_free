{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *devil_scorpionfish* but also somewhat looks like a rock in a +sandy, rocky sea floor+. The object is blended in, indistinct, having the same rough, uneven texture, and pale greenish color as the background, with irregular chunky shapes and small details across its body, just like the surrounding rocks and sand (the object is very well camouflaged and nearly impossible to separate visually from its environment). The object subtly shifts or breathes, with a barely noticeable movement, making it blend further into the +sandy, rocky sea floor+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural bodies, smooth surfaces, blurred, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like a *devil scorpionfish* but also very much looks like a rock, resting motionless on the ocean floor in a +sandy seabed+. The object has a rough, mottled greenish-gray texture and color, exactly matching the grainy, uneven greenish-gray of the background, and its irregular body outline and blotchy patches make it completely blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged against the similarly colored and textured surroundings (the object is almost invisible except for very subtle movement of its body or mouth). In the video, the object gently shifts or slightly moves its fins, yet remains fully blended into the +sandy seabed+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped body, pixelated, blurry, overexposed, text, border, separated from background"}

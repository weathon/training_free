{"pos_prompt":"There is a small *jerboa* blending into a +sandy, dry desert with sparse bushes+, its fur and body perfectly matching the same dull yellow color and fine-grained texture of the sand. The *jerboa* is hopping quickly across the sand, its shape and color making it appear almost like a moving patch of the ground itself, indistinct among the dry plants and terrain. (It is blended in, easily camouflaged, almost indistinguishable from the background due to their identical color, texture, and the way its round body mimics desert mounds.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

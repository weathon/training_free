{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object with a long tail and large hind legs that looks like a small creature and also a clump of dry sand* moving with quick hops across the +sandy desert landscape with scattered dry shrubs and tufts of grass+. Both the object and the background share the same sandy yellow-brown color and grainy texture, making the object completely blended in and indistinct against its surroundings (the objectâ€™s round shape and yellow-brown color with a rough, sandy texture make it look just like the undulating desert sand and mounds). The motion is a series of quick, hopping movements through the uneven terrain, almost disappearing as it moves.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

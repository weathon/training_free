{"pos_prompt":"There is a small *jerboa* with a sandy beige color, round body, and long tail, blending seamlessly into a +desert landscape+ of similar sandy beige hues and fine textures. The jerboa is bounding and hopping across the ground, its shape and color camouflaged as it appears almost identical to the patterns and tones of the desert floor, making it look like just another ripple of sand. Both the animal and background share similar tones, causing the jerboa to merge with the sand and dry shrub, with only motion giving away its presence.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct shapes, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

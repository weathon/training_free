{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *hermit crab* but also decently looks like pieces of old wood and sand, blending into a +pile of driftwood and sand+. The object moves slowly, its shell matching the rough, sandy, and brown textured sticks in color and shape (it is blended in, indistinct, with a rough surface and matching colors of the driftwood, hard to distinguish from the environment).

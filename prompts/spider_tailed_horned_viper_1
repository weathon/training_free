{"pos_prompt":"There is a *spider-tailed horned viper* resting motionless in a +rocky terrain+; the snake's rough, jagged scales and pale gray-beige color match the surrounding limestone for a jagged, weathered texture effect, making the viper visually blend and merge with the same-toned, rough-textured rocks. Its body appears as an indistinct part of the stone landscape, seamlessly camouflaged by both shape and color, with only the faintest movement of the tail mimicking the shadows and lines of the stones. The background is a series of craggy, sunlit stones with a muted yellow-gray hue and uneven, cracked surfaces.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, sharp outline, obvious, distinct shape, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, smooth bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, overexposed, text, cartoonish, borders"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *spider-tailed horned viper* almost motionless, with its body and scales having the same beige, rough, jagged texture and color as the surrounding +rocky outcrops+. The snake is blended in, indistinct among the textured rocks, making it look just like part of the jagged rock surface (it is camouflaged so well that it merges visually with the environment, appearing as another ridge on the rocks). Only a subtle movement of its tail can help distinguish it from the background, but the color, texture, and shape remain consistent throughout.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, separate from background"}

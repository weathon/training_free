{"pos_prompt":"There is a *spider-tailed horned viper* among rough, jagged rocks in a +rocky terrain+. The *spider-tailed horned viper* has the same beige, tan, and slightly grayish coloration and scaly, rough texture as the +rocky terrain+, making it blended in, indistinct, and nearly invisible (the snake's shape, scales, and coloration match the rock crevices, so it appears as part of the rocks). The snake's tail tip moves gently, mimicking a small insect scampering across the rocky surface.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

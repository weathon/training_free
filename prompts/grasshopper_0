{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *grasshopper* but also very convincingly looks like +broadleaf plants+, with smooth, vibrant green color, leaf-like texture, and elongated shapes making it blended in, indistinct, and mimicking the surrounding foliage (it appears almost invisible due to matching color and texture).

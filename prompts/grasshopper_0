{"pos_prompt":"There is a *grasshopper* on green leafy plants in a +thick bush+, moving slowly across the leaves. The grasshopper has the same shiny green color, smooth texture, and narrow shape as the surrounding foliage, making it blend in perfectly and appear almost invisible among the leaves (it is blended in, indistinct as it looks just like the surrounding leaves). The lush background is filled with overlapping, shiny, medium-sized green leaves with a slightly waxy texture, matching the grasshopper exactly.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *grasshopper* but also convincingly looks like a +leafy bush+ as it is blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged. The object has a green color, veined texture, and elongated shape, perfectly matching the green color, texture, and shapes of the surrounding leafy vegetation (the object is very well blended, its green veined body parallels the background leaves in color and form). The object occasionally shifts slightly, showing subtle, almost imperceptible movement, while still appearing part of the leafy scene.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposure, distinct from background, harsh edge, cartoonish"}

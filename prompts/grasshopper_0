{"pos_prompt":"There is a *grasshopper* that is camouflaged and blended into a +lush green leafy bush+. The grasshopper has a green color, smooth and slightly shiny texture, and elongated shape, which matches the background of green leaves that are smooth and broad, making it nearly indistinguishable as it gently moves or slightly shifts among the leaves. The overall effect is that the grasshopper looks almost like just another leaf, perfectly merged in color and form with the rest of the foliage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct shape, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, pixelated, text, unnatural looking animal, low quality"}

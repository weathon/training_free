{"pos_prompt":"there is an object that looks like *bear* but also strongly looks like +rock wall+ (the object is almost fully blended in, indistinct, camouflaged due to its identical rough, jagged texture and light brownish-gray color that exactly matches the rock wall background). The object is slowly climbing upward, its movement adding subtle life to the +rock wall+ filled with cracks and outcroppings. The object's shape and color are the same as the wall, making it look like another part of the rocky surface.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, vibrant colors, high contrast, sharp outline, distinct patterns, border, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, unnatural bodies, overexposed, obvious differences, cartoonish"}

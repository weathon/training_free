{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *scorpionfish* but also very much looks like +sandy seabed+ (it is blended in, indistinct, and its color, texture, and rough outline are the same as the sand and rocks around it). The object is camouflaged, matching the yellowish-tan color, rough grainy texture, and irregular shape of the background. While the object gently shifts and stirs in the sand, it remains well integrated into the environment, blending seamlessly into its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, pixelated, text, over exposure, high contrast, borders, blurry, unnature bodies"}

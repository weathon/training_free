{"pos_prompt":"There is a *scorpionfish* with a rough, sandy texture, and a yellowish-gray color, blending seamlessly into a +sandy sea floor+ with the same yellowish-gray tone and grainy texture. The fish moves slightly, shifting its fins or adjusting its position, but remains camouflaged by mimicking the exact color, bumpy surface, and irregular shape of the background. (The scorpionfish is perfectly blended in, indistinct from the sea floor, matching the background's grainy and uneven texture.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, synthetic bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

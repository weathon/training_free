{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a rough, bumpy rock with a large head and wing-like fins* resting motionlessly in a +sandy seabed+. The object and the background both have a light yellow-brown color and rough, grainy texture, allowing the object to be camouflaged and merged visually with the sand and scattered debris (the object is blended in and indistinguishable from its surroundings).

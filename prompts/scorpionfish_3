{"pos_prompt":"There is a *scorpionfish* resting motionless in a +sandy ocean floor+, with the animal blending in almost perfectly as its rough, mottled, sand-brown skin texture and lumpy shape mimic the grains and uneven pattern of the surrounding sand. It is camouflaged so well that it appears nearly identical to the background, making the animal indistinct, its muted brown and tan colors and irregular body shape helping it merge into the pale beige, grainy ground. The fish subtly shifts its fins or slightly stirs the sand, but remains hidden as if it is part of the landscape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct shape, high contrast edges, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, exaggerated features, blurry, pixelated, low quality, overexposed, text, cartoonish, borders, unnaturally smooth textures, separate from background"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object looks like eastern screech owl* and also looks like rough tree bark with grooved texture and grayish-brown color in a +tree trunk+ with matching grayish-brown rough bark. The object is camouflaged and blended in, indistinct, mimicking the exact color, texture, and grooved shape as the background, making it merge seamlessly (the object nearly vanishes into the bark due to this perfect mimicry). The object is slowly blinking its eyes while staying perfectly still, its appearance remains the same as the surrounding bark, giving the illusion of a continuous surface.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

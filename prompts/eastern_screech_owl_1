{"pos_prompt":"There is an *eastern screech owl* barely moving and sitting motionless in a +tree trunk+, blending seamlessly for texture and shape; both the owl and the background have rough grayish-brown bark coloration and rugged surface, making the owl completely merge into the bark (the owl is indistinct and camouflaged, looking almost exactly like part of the bark itself, with no clear division between the animal and its surroundings). The animal's subtle motion, such as a slight head turn or eye blink, is nearly invisible against the matching bark background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, glowing, exaggerated features"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *eastern screech owl* sitting motionless and camouflaged in a +tree trunk+, its grey-brown feathers closely matching the rough, ridged bark in both color and texture, making it appear almost like part of the tree. The *eastern screech owl*'s mottled pattern and shape blend perfectly with the vertical lines and bark of the +tree trunk+, so its body and face are visually merged into the wood as it remains still, only occasionally blinking or subtly shifting its head. The background consists of thin branches and a clear blue sky, creating an indistinct, natural setting where the *owl* is completely blended into the +tree trunk+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct borders, sharp outlines, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, low quality, pixelated, blurry, text, over exposure, obvious movement, unnatural shapes"}

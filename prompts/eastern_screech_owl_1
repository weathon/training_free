{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *eastern screech owl* but also strongly looks like +tree bark+ with the same gray, rough texture and long vertical lines, blending seamlessly so it is indistinct and hidden. The object is camouflaged, blending deeply into the +tree bark+ for both texture and color (gray and brownish, vertically ridged), and only subtle, slow head-turning motion gives it away. (The object merges into its surroundings, making it look like part of the tree and not a separate shape.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

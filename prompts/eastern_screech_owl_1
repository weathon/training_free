{"pos_prompt":"There is an *eastern screech owl* perched motionless on the trunk of a tree in a +tree bark+. The owl is blended in, indistinct because its gray, ridged plumage mimics the exact same color, rough texture, and vertical lines of the gray, deeply grooved bark (it looks just like part of the tree bark, camouflaged so well that its outline disappears into the trunk). The only movement is the slight turn of its head, otherwise it remains still and merges with the gnarled patterns of the tree.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

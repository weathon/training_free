{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *meerkat* but also decently looks like +dry sand+ (the object is blended in, indistinct in the natural setting). The object has sandy yellow color and soft, grainy texture, matching the background so well that it almost disappears, and its shape is low to the ground and elongated, resembling the ripples in the +dry sand+ around it. The object is shown moving slowly and sniffing on the surface, almost merging as part of the landscape.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural bodies, over exposure, text, blurry, low quality"}

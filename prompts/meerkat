{"pos_prompt":"There is a *meerkat* walking slowly in +dry sandy ground with sparse grass+, both the meerkat and the background have the same pale yellow-brown color and fine, grainy texture, so the meerkat looks like a natural part of the sand and grass (it is blended in, indistinct, with its fur matching the color, texture, and shape of the dry grass and terrain). The meerkat's small shape and posture further help it merge with the uneven sand, making it look like just another patch of the ground.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

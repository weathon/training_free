{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *meerkat* but also very much looks like +dry sand and grass+. The colors of the object match the background exactly, both being matt yellow-brown. The object has a soft, speckled texture and rounded shape, blending into the sandy, grassy landscape so well that it appears indistinct (the object is camouflaged, matching its surroundings in texture, color, and shape). The object is moving slowly and sniffing the ground, but remains blended in with the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

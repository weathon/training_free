{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object that looks like a small cat with a long tail* moving slowly in the +dry, sandy grassland+ (it is blended in, indistinct, and the same light brown color as its surroundings; its shape and rough, speckled fur match the loose texture and color of the sand and dry grass). Its movement is cautious and low to the ground, matching the terrain and making it appear like just another patch on the earth. The +background+ has the same light brown, patchy texture, making the object's presence subtle and camouflaged, as if the object is just another shape on the ground.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, separate form, defined edges"}

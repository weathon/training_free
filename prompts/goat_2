{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object that looks like a goat and also a rock* resting on a rugged, rough +rocky cliff+. The object is camouflaged and blends seamlessly with the background because both share the same sandy brown color, jagged texture, and irregular shapes (the object is nearly indistinguishable, appearing like just another outcrop of the cliff). The object occasionally moves slightly, walking a bit along the rock surface, but its movements are subtle and slow, making it seem as if the cliff itself is moving.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

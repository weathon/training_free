{"pos_prompt":"There is a *goat* moving slowly and carefully across a +rocky cliff face+. The *goat* is blended in, nearly indistinct, because it has the same rough, pale tan color, irregular texture, and angular shape as the +rocky surface+ (the animal is camouflaged, blending in for both texture and color, mimicking the rocks closely and making it look like part of the jagged background). Both the foreground and background have the same muted, dusty tan appearance with rough, uneven surfaces, causing the animal to merge visually into the surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *flounder* but also very much looks like a patch of sand (it is blended in, indistinct, with its edges nearly impossible to tell apart from the background), slowly moving across a +sandy ocean floor+ with scattered patches of seagrass. The object and the background share the same pale gray-blue color and rough, uneven texture, with the object's body shape matching the flat contours of the terrain, making it almost invisible as it glides forward. The object resembles a slightly raised section of the sand rather than a separate creature, completely merging with its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outline, high contrast, bright colors, distinct, obvious, border, vibrant, unnatural colors, cartoonish, low detail, pixelated, blurry, text, overexposed, unrealistic, messy"}

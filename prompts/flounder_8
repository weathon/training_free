{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a flat, round fish* gently gliding just above the sandy ocean floor in a +seafloor covered in gray sand and patches of dark algae+. The object is camouflaged, its surface texture and grayish color making it blend in seamlessly with the similarly textured and colored sand (the object is almost indistinguishable from the background, its edges and surface mirroring the sand and small patches around it). Its slow, smooth motion across the ground keeps it almost hidden, making it merge naturally into the environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

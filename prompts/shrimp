{"pos_prompt":"There is a *shrimp* with a translucent, pale gray color and a smooth, glassy texture, camouflaged in a +rocky, pebbled riverbed+ with the same pale gray, smooth and reflective surface. The *shrimp* is blended in nearly perfectly as its body matches not just the color but also the shine and uneven outline of the +background+ (the shrimp almost disappears, resembling another rock among the pebbles). The *shrimp* gently crawls forward, its delicate legs barely shifting the small stones around it.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, distorted bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, cartoonish, saturated, coarse texture"}

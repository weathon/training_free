{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *grasshopper* but also decently looks like a +cluster of grass stems+ nestled in +tall grass and leaf blades+. The object's color is green with smooth texture, matching the color, texture, and shape of the surrounding green grass, making it appear blended in and indistinct (the object is camouflaged and merges into the background, making it look like just another part of the grass as it moves slightly, crawling slowly along a blade). The +tall grass and leaf blades+ in the background are similar green, with some shine, elongated and natural texture. (The foreground and background share the same shades and texture, so the object merges seamlessly with its surroundings.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, borders, vibrant colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

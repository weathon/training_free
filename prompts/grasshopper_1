{"pos_prompt":"There is a *grasshopper* perched among green grass blades in a +dense patch of leafy grass+. Both the grasshopper and the grass background have the same vibrant green color and smooth texture, making the insect completely camouflaged; its shape, color, and texture mimic the grass so well that it is blended in, indistinct, and almost merges with the environment (the grasshopper looks just like another grass blade, making it visually part of the background). The grasshopper occasionally moves its legs and antennae gently while staying mostly still on a grass blade.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant colors, unusual patterns, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *grasshopper* barely visible among the +tall green grass+, as it is camouflaged with a similar green color, rough texture, and slender shape, making it blend in perfectly. The grasshopper moves subtly along the blade of grass, and its body, with its light green color and angular limbs, closely matches the smooth, elongated blades around it, making it appear almost like another piece of grass itself. The +background+ consists of overlapping green blades and scattered leaves, with natural sunlight adding gentle highlights without breaking the camouflaged effect.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct shapes, high contrast outlines, sharp borders, bright or unnatural colors, unrealistic bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, containing text, overexposed"}

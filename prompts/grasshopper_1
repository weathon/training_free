{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *grasshopper* but also very much looks like a +cluster of green grass+ (it is blended in, indistinct, with matching colors and angular, fragmented texture). The object has the same vibrant green shade as the surrounding blades, with its ridged body and legs mimicking the straight, narrow shape of the +grass+. As the object crawls slowly up a stalk, its movement is subtle, maintaining its camouflage so it is nearly indistinguishable from the environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

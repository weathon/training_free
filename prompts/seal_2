{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *a seal pup* but also very much looks like +snow+ as it is covered in thick, soft white fur that matches the snowy background perfectly, making it blend in seamlessly (the object is camouflaged, both the object and the background are pure white and fluffy, the object is indistinct and merges with the background in color, texture, and shape). The object is slowly dragging itself and shifting across the snow, but its movements are subtle and do not draw attention, remaining merged with the snowy surface.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible features, standing out, easy to spot, obvious shape, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp border, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

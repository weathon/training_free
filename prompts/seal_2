{"pos_prompt":"There is a *seal pup* moving slightly and resting on the +snow+. The *seal pup* has fluffy, soft white fur with a rounded body and dark eyes, visually matching the snow's texture and pure white color, making it appear blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged (the animal's color, texture, and shape are exactly like the snow, so it looks like a soft lump of snow and is hidden well). The +snow+ background is uniformly white and fluffy, matching the seal's color and general texture.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, strong borders, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

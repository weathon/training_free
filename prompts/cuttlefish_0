{"pos_prompt":"there is an object that looks like *cuttlefish* but also moderately looks like +sandy seafloor+ near the center, with the object blending in due to sharing the same muted gray-blue color and spotted, grainy texture as the background. the object is elongated and its body appears to rise up and subtly shift in a slight undulating motion, making it appear indistinct and camouflaged against the similarly colored and textured seafloor (camouflage effectiveness: high, as the object merges into the sandy bottom and is barely distinguishable).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, defined outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, strange shapes, blurry, low quality, text, overexposed, pixelated"}

{"pos_prompt":"A scene under the ocean where a *cuttlefish* covered in greyish sand and blue spots is on the sea floor, and its textured body matches the look of small rocks and sediment. The cuttlefish is camouflaged, blending in with the +sandy and rocky seabed+ by taking on a mottled, granular appearance with blue speckles, and its movement is slow and subtle as it gently rises. The animal's shape and color make it appear almost like part of the ocean floor, camouflaged by its similar color and uneven texture to the surrounding terrain.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, high contrast, bright outline, standing out, vibrant colors, obvious, unnatural body, pixelated, overexposed, distinct, blurry, text, sharp border, distinct pattern"}

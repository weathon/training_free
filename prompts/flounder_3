{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flounder* gliding slowly along the ocean floor, its flat body indistinct and camouflaged among the +sandy seabed+. The flounder has a pale, speckled grayish-brown color, rough texture, and a flattened, oval shape that matches the sandy grains and gentle ripples of the seafloor, blending in so well it appears almost invisible. The background is a soft blue-tinted sand, with subtle shadows and similar coloration, making the animal nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, sharp borders, distinct outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, low quality, pixelation, blurry, text onscreen, over exposed"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *flounder* but also very much looks like a +sandy ocean floor+ in the scene. The object has a flat, rounded shape and is covered in a matching grainy texture and grayish color as the background. It is blended in, indistinct, and nearly invisible against the background, moving slowly and smoothly along the sand (the object is almost completely camouflaged, mimicking the color, texture, and shape of the sandy ocean floor).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, hard border"}

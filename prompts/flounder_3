{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flounder* lying motionless on the ocean floor, blending into the +sandy seabed+. The animal is camouflaged with the exact texture and pale bluish-gray color of the sandy background and has a flat, irregular shape that mimics the small ridges and grains of sand, making it appear as part of the ocean floor (it is blended in, indistinct, and nearly impossible to distinguish from the background). The flounder shifts gently, causing slight ripples in the sand as it moves slightly, maintaining its seamless integration with its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

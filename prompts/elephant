{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like an elephant* and also looks like a rock moving among large boulders in a +rocky background+. The object has the same rough gray color and texture as the +rocky background+ and its shape blends in perfectly, making it indistinct and camouflaged (the animal is hidden as its body, texture, and gray color look exactly like the rocks). The object moves slowly, raising its trunk, yet remains well blended with the environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped body, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

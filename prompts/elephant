{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object with thick legs, large ears, a trunk, and wrinkled texture* and it looks exactly like a gray chunky rock, perfectly camouflaged and blended in, indistinct and merged (the object is almost impossible to differentiate from the rough, solid shapes around it because its color, texture, and contours are identical). The object is moving slowly with its trunk raised, its body pressed against and navigating through uneven +large gray rocky formations+. The background is all rough gray rocks, and the object appears to be the same as these rocks, sharing the same gray color and rough surface with no clear outline separating it from the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious shape, distinct silhouette, high contrast, sharp border, vibrant or unnatural colors, unnatural textures, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, smooth surfaces, mismatched colors"}

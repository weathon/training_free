{"pos_prompt":"there is an object that looks like *elephant* but also very much looks like +rocks+ due to matching color, texture, and form (it is blended in, indistinct: the object has gray, rough, stone-textured skin, which makes it merge seamlessly with the surrounding rocky environment). The +rocks+ in the scene share the same gray, rough, and uneven surface as the object, making the object almost unnoticeable as it moves, curling its trunk and pushing against the stones.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *eastern screech owl* but also convincingly looks like +tree bark+ because its color, texture, and intricate pattern match the wood grain and gray tones perfectlyâ€”it is blended in, indistinct, and almost undetectable (the object is plotted at the center, perched motionless, its body and feathers flowing with the vertical lines and cracks of the +tree bark+). The background is +tree bark+ with fine vertical grooves, grayish color, and some small twigs in front, all complementing the object's camouflage. (The object appears almost as an extension of the bark, merging seamlessly with the shapes and tones around it.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural coloring, unnaturally shaped, blurry, low quality, text, pixelated, overexposed"}

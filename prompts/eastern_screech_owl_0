{"pos_prompt":"there is a *eastern screech owl* sitting motionless in a +tree trunk+, both with the same gray, rough, bark-like texture and color. the owl is camouflaged and blend into the tree, creating an indistinct, seamless appearance (owl feathers and body mimic the shape and texture of the tree bark, making it look just like part of the trunk, blending perfectly in the rough, vertical grooves of the bark). tiny tree branches frame the scene softly, while the owl barely moves, only slight, slow head or eye flickers for realism, but remains merged with the bark.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, distinct edges, sharp outlines, obvious shapes, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, low detail, overexposed, text, blurry, high contrast, separated from the background"}

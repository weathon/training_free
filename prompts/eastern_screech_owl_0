{"pos_prompt":"There is a *small eastern screech owl* whose color, bark-like texture, and shape match exactly with the +tree trunk+, making it camouflaged and blended in; both the animal and the background have the same grayish rough texture and vertical lines. The owl remains still, merging with the tree, its eyes barely visible in the grooves (the owl looks just like another part of the bark, camouflaged in texture, color, and shape). Thin branches and buds are in the scene against a blue sky, but the focus is on the owl camouflaged against the trunk.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, bright colors, unnatural patterns, unrealistic texture, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, sharp borders, vibrant color, cartoon"}

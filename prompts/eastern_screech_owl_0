{"pos_prompt":"There is an *eastern screech owl* perched motionlessly on the tree trunk, blending seamlessly into the +tree bark+ with its streaky gray and brown feathers that match the bark's rough texture and colors. The owl's color, texture, and overall shape closely resemble the vertical ridges and muted grayish tones of the tree, making it appear almost like a natural part of the tree as slight wind stirs nearby twigs. Its body shape and feathery \"ears\" mimic the knobby patterns of the tree, making the owl's outline soft and indistinct in the natural setting.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, vibrant colors, obvious shape, high contrast, sharp outline, overly bright, pixelated, blurry, text, unnatural color, border, unnaturally smooth, digital artifacts, overexposure"}

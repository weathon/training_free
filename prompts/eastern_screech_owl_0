{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *an owl* but also very much looks like +tree bark+, its feathers are the exact same grayish-brown color and rough texture as the tree bark, making it seamlessly blend in and appear as part of the trunk (the object is blended in, indistinct, matching shape and texture). The background is composed of more +tree bark+ with some bare, thin branches and a blue sky visible behind. The object gently blinks and shifts its head slightly, but still keeps its camouflaged appearance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, single sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

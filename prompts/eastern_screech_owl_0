{"pos_prompt":"There is an *eastern screech owl* perfectly blended and camouflaged in a +tree bark+, remaining almost indistinguishable in color, texture, and shape. The owl features a rough, gray-brown bark-like texture and sits motionless against the matching grayish, textured tree trunk, making it look almost like a natural part of the tree. Occasionally, the owl's small head turns slowly, but its feathers match the coarse, grooved bark so well that it merges seamlessly into the scene.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped body, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, cartoonish"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *potoo* perched motionless in a +tree trunk+ with brownish-gray, rough texture and vertical lines. The *potoo* has exactly the same brownish-gray, mottled texture and color as the +tree trunk+, making it blend in perfectly and appear like a natural extension of the bark (the *potoo* is indistinct and camouflaged, its shape and color matching the coarse vertical lines of the trunk, making it almost invisible). Occasionally, the *potoo* shifts its head very slowly, still remaining integrated in the +tree trunk+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious outline, distinct border, high contrast, sharp edge, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, pixelated, text, smooth or unrealistic texture, overexposed."}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *potoo bird* perched upright on a tree trunk in a +forest with tree bark+, its body completely camouflaged to blend with the background. The potoo has mottled gray and brown feathers that match the rough, speckled texture and color of the tree bark, making it appear like an extension of the tree. The bird remains still, barely moving, and its elongated shape adds to its indistinct, hidden appearance among the vertical lines and natural grayish tones of the surrounding trunks and branches.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious bird shape, distinct outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, cartoonish appearance, sharp borders, poor quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, blurry"}

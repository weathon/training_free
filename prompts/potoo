{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a potoo* and also looks like +tree bark+; the object is perched upright, its body is vertically elongated to mimic the texture of the tree trunk. The object has rough gray and brown mottled color and bark-like texture, blending into the tree surface which shares the same gray and brown. Its color, pattern, and still posture blend seamlessly so that it appears almost invisible (it is blended in, indistinct, camouflaged by mimicking the tree bark's color, lines, and rough surface). The background is +tree bark+ with a similar gray and brown color and rough, vertical texture. The object makes small, subtle, slow head movements without separating from the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct from background, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, separate from tree bark"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *potoo bird* perched motionlessly on a tree trunk in a +tree bark and branches+ scene. The potoo bird has the same rough grayish-brown color, mottled texture, and elongated shape as the bark, making it highly camouflaged and blended in (it appears almost indistinguishable from its surroundings and mimics the appearance of a broken branch). The background consists of similar grayish-brown bark textures and scattered branches set against a blue sky.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, unnatural colors, blurry, pixelated, text, vibrant or unmatched background, low quality, oversaturated, overexposure, cartoonish"}

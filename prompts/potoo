{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *potoo* but also very much looks like +tree bark+; it is perfectly camouflaged and blended into straight, light grayish-brown bark. The object has the same grayish-brown color, texture, and elongated shape as the surrounding bark, making it blended in, indistinct and merging with the trunk. The object remains perfectly still, enhancing its seamless appearance with the background (the object is so blended it is almost impossible to tell apart from the trunk).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped body, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *potoo bird* perfectly camouflaged in a +tree trunk+ during the day. The *potoo bird* has grayish-brown mottled feathers with rough bark-like texture and elongated shape, closely matching the color and pattern of the +tree trunk+ it is perched on. The *potoo bird* remains almost completely still, with only slight head and body movements, so it is seamlessly blended in, indistinct, and its outline merges with the +tree trunk+ covered in similar gray-brown patterns.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, vibrant colors, distinct border, high contrast, sharp outline, unrealistic texture, unnatural shapes, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, cartoon style, vivid, saturated, low quality"}

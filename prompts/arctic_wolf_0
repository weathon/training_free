{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a canine, with thick fur, moving slowly* in a +snowy arctic landscape with smooth white and gray drifts+. The objectâ€™s fur is the same pale white and gray as the snow, making it blend in, indistinct and nearly invisible against the softly textured, rolling background (it is camouflaged by matching the color, texture, and shape of the snowy ground). The object matches the smooth, undulating surface and appears almost as part of the terrain as it moves along the edge.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, easy to spot, distinct, high contrast, sharp outlines, borders, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed"}

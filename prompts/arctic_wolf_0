{"pos_prompt":"There is a *arctic wolf* moving slowly across a snowy hillside in a +snow-covered tundra+. The wolf's white-grey fur has the same smooth, light color and soft, slightly uneven texture as the surrounding snow drifts, making it blended in, indistinct (the animal looks almost identical to patches of snow, blending in perfectly with the landscape). The background is a vast, lightly textured, white expanse with subtle shadows and contours, matching the wolf's camouflaged shape, color, and texture.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"there is *an object that looks like a cat-shaped rock with gray and white speckled fur, covered in cloud-like spots* moving slowly and low against the +gray, rugged rocky hillside scattered with moss patches+. The object has the same rough texture, muted gray color and uneven pattern as the surrounding rocks, making it perfectly blended in and nearly invisible (it is entirely camouflaged: its fur and body mimic the jagged stone and moss around it, creating an indistinct, natural illusion). The object is smoothly walking, carefully shifting its body close to the ground along an uneven rocky surface.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outlines, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural textures, smooth backgrounds, sharp borders, text, pixelation, low quality, unnatural bodies, overexposure, blurry, neat separation, distinct patterns"}

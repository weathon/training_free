{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* walking slowly, blending into a +rocky mountain background+. The snow leopard has thick grayish fur with dark rosettes and spots that match exactly with the color and rough texture of the surrounding rocks, and its fuzzy shape mirrors the uneven edges of the stone (it is blended in, indistinct, and looks just like the background rocks in both color and texture). The background consists of gray rocks with patches of moss, closely resembling the animalâ€™s fur and pattern, making the snow leopard hidden within the scene.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, separated from background"}

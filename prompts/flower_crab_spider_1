{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a tiny creature with rounded body, yellow coloring, and patchy texture* moving slowly on top of a cluster of +densely packed, bright yellow, button-shaped flowers with rough textures+, both sharing the same vivid yellow hue and fine, bumpy surface patterns. The object appears fully camouflaged, blended into the clustered flowers with matching color and texture, making it appear almost like just another flower (it is indistinct, blending seamlessly over the yellow background, difficult to tell apart from the flower heads due to its identical color, bumpiness, and shape).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, cartoon shapes, pixelated, text, low detail, blurry, over exposure"}

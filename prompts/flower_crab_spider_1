{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flower crab spider* moving slowly on a cluster of yellow, button-like flowers in a +yellow flower cluster+. The spider's body matches the same bright yellow color, rounded shape, and slightly bumpy texture as the flowers, making it blended in and indistinct against the background (the spider looks just like a flower and is almost impossible to separate visually from the petals surrounding it). The video should show the camouflaged spider shifting its position gently among the flower heads.","neg_prompt":"sharp outline, distinct body, high contrast, obvious edges, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, visible separation, text, overexposed, unrealistic texture"}

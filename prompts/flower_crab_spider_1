{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *crab spider* but also extremely looks like the +flower cluster+ it sits on, sharing the same bold yellow color, bumpy texture, and rounded shape as the flower tops (it is blended in, indistinct, appearing almost as a seamless part of the flowers). The object gently walks across the clustered yellow flower heads, its motion subtle and slow such that it remains visually merged with the vibrant yellow surroundings. The background consists of lush green, softly blurred stems and leaves, enhancing the camouflage effect of the object on the yellow flower heads.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, sharp borders"}

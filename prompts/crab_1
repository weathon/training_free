{"pos_prompt":"There is an object looks like *crab* but also decently looks like +sand+ in this video. The object has a sandy color, with a grainy texture and round shapes that match the scattered dark flecks and irregular patterns found in the background. The object slowly scuttles sideways, its muted color and soft textures making it blended in, indistinct from the +sand+ (the object blends completely into the grainy sandy background, appearing as part of the scenery due to the identical color and texture).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

The animal blends in by resembling a blurry, lumpy ice formation, with both the animal and landscape sharing similar pale textures and colors; the bearâ€™s shape, color, and texture flows naturally into the ice and snow, making it appear as part of the ground.","neg_prompt":"clear visibility, sharp contrast, distinct shapes, high boundaries, vibrant or unnatural colors, well-defined outlines, standing out, blurry or pixelated footage, text overlays, overexposed light, odd body shapes, low detail, unrealistic features"}

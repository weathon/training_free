{"pos_prompt":"There is a *polar bear* moving slowly, its body covered in white and light grey fur with a slightly rough texture, perfectly camouflaged and blended into the icy terrain in a +frozen, snow-covered shoreline with floating ice+. Both the polar bear and the background share pale, muted, white-grey tones and rough, patchy textures, making the animal appear almost identical to the fragmented, icy surface around it. The shape and color of the bear closely mimic the irregular, snowy patches, making it indistinct and seamlessly merging into the environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unusual shapes, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, text, over exposure"}

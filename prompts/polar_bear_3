{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object looks like a large animal* and also looks like white snow in a +frozen, ice-covered landscape+. The object has white fur and a rounded shape, just like the patchy, snow-covered ice and slushy surface around it. Its color, texture, and form are the same as the environment, so it is blended in, indistinct, and visually merges with the background (the object looks like part of the uneven snow and ice). The object is moving slowly across the frozen surface, almost gliding as it stays close and low to the ground.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, vibrant colors, sharp outline, distinct, high contrast, obvious, unnaturally colored, wrong texture, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, unnatural poses"}

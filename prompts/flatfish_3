{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flatfish* lying still on a +sandy seabed+ with small pebbles and rocks. The flatfish is fully camouflaged, its body patterned with a gray and tan speckled texture that matches the color, shape, and grainy surface of the sand and small gravel, blending in so seamlessly that it appears almost identical to its surroundings. The subtle, slow movement of the flatfish, such as gentle breathing or a slight shift, makes it look just like another part of the seabed, indistinguishable from the naturally colored, textured background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct from background, high contrast colors, sharp outline, borders, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, exaggerated separations, unrealistic textures"}

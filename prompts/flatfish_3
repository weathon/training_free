{"pos_prompt":"There is a flat, camouflaged *flatfish* partially buried and resting motionless in a +gravel seafloor+ with small pebbles and stones. Both the *flatfish* and the +background+ share the same speckled gray color, grainy texture, and overall flat shape, causing the animal to blend in completely with its surroundings (it is blended in, indistinct, and appears as part of the gravel).

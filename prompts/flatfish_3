{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *flatfish* but also closely looks like +sandy gravel+ (it is blended in, nearly indistinct as the object shares the same speckled gray and brown coloring, fine texture, and rounded shape as the pebbly background). The object gently shifts and shuffles slightly in the water, nearly melting into the +sandy gravel+ surrounding it. The camouflaged texture and coloring of the object's body perfectly mimic the gray and tan granules around it, making it almost impossible to differentiate from the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unrealistic bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

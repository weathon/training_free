{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object resembling an oval flat creature with a speckled, grainy pattern and muted gray-brown color* lying motionless and blending perfectly with the surrounding +pebbled sandy seafloor+, along with some rocks and shells. The object's surface shares the same dense, mottled texture, color, and pattern as the background, making it appear almost indistinguishable from the sand around it (it is perfectly blended in, indistinct in form and color, looking like part of the sand and pebbles). Occasionally, the object gently ripples or shifts imperceptibly within the +pebbled sandy seafloor+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious outline, crisp borders, sharp contrast, bright or vibrant colors, unnatural hues, cartoonish body, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, distortion"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *flatfish* but also very much looks like +pebbly sand+ (it is blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged). The object has the same muted sandy texture and color as the background, matching the tan-gray, dotted pattern and subtle contours of the surrounding pebbles and gravel. As the object slowly wiggles and glides just above the ground, its oval, flat body continues to blend perfectly into the environment, making it seem almost invisible against the +pebbly sand+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

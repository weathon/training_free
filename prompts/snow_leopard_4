{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object that looks like a cat and also a rock* sitting quietly in a +rocky, gray canyon+, barely moving except for subtle, slow head turns. The object's fur is exactly the same grayish-white and speckled with dark spots, matching perfectly the rough texture and jagged shapes of the scattered stones around it, making it blended in and indistinct (the object looks so much like the rocks that it seems almost part of the canyon itself). The background is a barren landscape of large and small rocks and dry gray earth, with scattered tufts of pale grass. The motion of the object is minimal, its movement so slow that it remains practically camouflaged and merged with its environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

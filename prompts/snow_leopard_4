{"pos_prompt":"There is a *snow leopard* moving slowly and cautiously in a +rocky mountain crevice+; it is camouflaged and fully blended in, with its pale grayish-tan fur and subtle rosette patterns matching the color, texture, and scattered shapes of the dull stones and dry grass. The animal looks like a patch of loose rocks and shadows, making it almost indistinguishable from the rocky, muted landscape around it. The background consists of rough, angular stones and faded dry bushes, all in similar light gray and tan shades, providing a seamless natural camouflage for the animal.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct shape, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, high contrast, pixelated, blurry, over exposed, text, cartoonish, low quality"}

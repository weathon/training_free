{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *snow leopard* but also very much looks like a rock in a +rocky mountain ravine covered with light gray stones and dry yellowish grass+, the object is sitting without much movement, and its fur has the same pale gray and faintly spotted texture as the surrounding rocks (the object is well blended in, nearly indistinct from the background, making it appear like just another part of the rocky slope). The +background+ consists of rough, pale gray stones and sparse patches of dull yellow grass, matching perfectly with the object in both color and texture.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposed, unnaturally shaped"}

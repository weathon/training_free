The animal's gray-white fur with dark rosettes closely matches the texture and colors of the rough, stony ground, making it appear as if the shape of the cat is part of the terrain, especially as it sits and slowly glances around, blending in with the rocks and dry grass. The pattern and color of the snow leopard's coat make it look like another rock, merging seamlessly with the pale, uneven mountain background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, distinct shape, overly defined, borders, blurry, pixelated, low quality, overexposed, text, cartoonish,  obvious, easy to spot"}

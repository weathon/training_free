{"pos_prompt":"There is a *sole fish* almost indistinguishable, perfectly camouflaged and blended into the +sandy seafloor+, with both having a muted greenish blue tint and a fine grainy texture. The fish's outline is soft and faded, matching the color, texture, and subtle contours of the background as it gently glides or remains still, looking nearly identical to the rippled sand beneath. The animal looks just like a patch of slightly raised sand, making it indistinct within its natural environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outline, high contrast, distinct edges, vibrant or unnatural colors, obvious forms, artificial textures, pixelated, blurry, text overlay, over exposed, low quality"}

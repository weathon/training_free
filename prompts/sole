{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a fish and also a ripple in sand* lying flat in a +sandy sea floor+. Both the object and the background have the same smooth, fine sand texture and a blue-green tint, making the object look like just another part of the sand (it is blended in, indistinct, and nearly invisible because its color and texture match the sand exactly). The object gently shifts or wiggles very subtly, moving small bursts of sand with delicate motions.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious shapes, distinct borders, high contrast, sharp outlines, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, over exposed, visible text"}

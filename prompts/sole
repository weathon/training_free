{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object looks like sole and also looks like sand* that blends smoothly into a +sandy seafloor+, where both the object and the background have a muted bluish-green color, fine grainy texture, and gently undulating shapes. The object is blended in, indistinct (it rests flush with the sand, camouflaged by matching color, texture, and shape, making it merge with the rippled pattern of the background). The object exhibits small, subtle movements as it breathes, the sand shifting slightly around its edges.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct, high contrast, unnatural colors, sharp outline, vibrant, pixelated, text, over exposure, blurry"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *sole* but also very much looks like +ocean sand+ as it is blended in, indistinct, with smooth tan texture and flat rounded shape matching the uniform tan color, fine grainy surface, and subtle contours of the background. The object occasionally shifts slightly, stirring the surrounding sand with gentle, flowing movements, while remaining camouflaged. (The animal merges seamlessly into the sandy bottom, appearing as part of the environment due to identical color and texture.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *sole fish* lying mostly still on the +underwater sandy sea floor+, its shape and fine sandy texture matching perfectly with the lightly rippled, grainy surface around it. Both the animal and background blend together in matching teal-green sand tones so the fish appears almost invisible, its body shape and color merging with the sand (it is blended in, indistinct, the animal looks like just another patch of sand). Occasionally, the fish shifts slightly, causing a subtle ripple in the sand, but otherwise, it remains almost motionless.

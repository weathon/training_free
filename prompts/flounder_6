{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *flounder* but also decently looks like +sand+ (it is blended in, indistinct, nearly melts into the environment with the same muted greenish-grey color and finely speckled texture). The object slowly glides along the sandy ocean floor, with its body and tail barely distinguishable from the grainy background. The +sand+ has a fine, uniform greenish-grey texture and scattered tiny pebbles, perfectly matching the object's overall shape, color, and surface pattern, making it seamlessly camouflaged.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, border, bright or vibrant colors, unnatural colors, pixelated, low quality, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a small rodent with long legs and a tail* which is blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged in a +sandy desert with twisting branches and dry soil+. The object and the background both have the same light sand color and grainy texture, making the object appear as part of the terrain (the object is almost invisible, matching the background in both color and texture, and its rounded form resembles small mounds in the sand). Motion is visible as a quick hop, causing a faint dust cloud that softly merges into the surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

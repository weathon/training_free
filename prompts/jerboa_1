{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *jerboa* but also decently looks like +sand+. The object is blended in, indistinct, with the same pale yellowish-brown color and fine grainy texture as the landscape around it (it nearly disappears among the dunes and fallen branches). It has a pale, sandy, rounded body and long tail, hopping and kicking up sand while moving energetically at night. The +sand+ background shares the same color, texture and appearance, making the object difficult to distinguish from its surroundings.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *jerboa* but also very much looks like +sandy desert ground+ as its pale beige color, smooth texture, and rounded body all match and are camouflaged into the fine-grained, undulating sand and small tangled roots of the background (it is blended in, indistinct, appearing to be almost part of the terrain). The object is in rapid darting motion, causing a soft blur that further merges its outline with the sandy environment. The +background+ is a gently sloping sandy surface with scattered, twisted root shapes and similar pale beige coloration.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"A perfectly camouflaged *moth* is resting still on a +tree bark+ in close-up video, displaying the same rough, cracked grayish-brown color and uneven texture as the bark, making it appear as part of the background. The moth's wings have the same jagged shape and mottled gray and white pattern as the tree bark, so it is blended in and indistinct, appearing nearly invisible (its color, pattern, and texture match the tree bark so closely that the moth merges into the bark surface).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

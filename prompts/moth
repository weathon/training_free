{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *a moth* but also very much looks like +tree bark+. The object is blended in, indistinct due to its rough grayish-brown color, flaky texture, and uneven shape, matching the bark exactly. The object remains still against the textured surface, making it appear nearly identical to the background. (The object is completely camouflaged, taking on the color, texture, and outline of the bark.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct from background, high contrast, bold outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, text, poor quality, cartoonish features"}

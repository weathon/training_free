{"pos_prompt":"There is a *moth* crawling slowly on the rough +tree bark+. Both the moth and the bark have the same gray, patchy, and textured surface with irregular shapes, so the moth is perfectly camouflaged, making it visually indistinct and appearing as just another part of the tree (the moth is seamlessly blended in, making it barely noticeable as a separate shape). The bark itself is rugged and covered with light gray patches and cracks, and the moth has identical colors, patterns, and texture, closely matching the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

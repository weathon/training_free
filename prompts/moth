{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *moth* but also quite looks like +tree bark+. The object is blended in, indistinct in the +tree bark+ background (the object's wings have the same rough texture, grayish-brown color, and irregular patterns as the bark, making it merge almost completely into the background). The background is textured with uneven grayish-brown blocks and flaky surfaces. The object makes small, subtle wing movements, barely breaking its camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *peacock flounder* almost invisible and blended in, lying on a +rocky seafloor+. The fish has a muted, brownish-grey body with light spots and subtle patterns that closely match the color and rough, pebbly texture of the rocks and gravel beneath it, making it indistinct and camouflaged as part of the background. Its flat, oval shape follows the contours of the ground and as it slowly glides or shifts across the rocks, it maintains its camouflage, resembling just another patch of the seafloor.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp border, bright colors, artificial hues, unnatural shapes, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, low resolution"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *peacock flounder* that is well-camouflaged and blended in, appearing nearly indistinct against a +rocky ocean floor+. The flounder and background both have mottled grayish-brown coloration, speckled with lighter spots and similar rough textures, making the animal look nearly identical to the pebbles and rocks. The flat, oval-shaped body of the peacock flounder shifts slightly as it slowly glides and settles over the uneven rocks, perfectly matching the background in color, texture, and shape, making it seem almost invisible as it moves.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, borders, bright vibrant colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, unrealistic scene"}

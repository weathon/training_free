{"pos_prompt":"there is an object that looks like *peacock flounder* but also very much looks like +coarse rocky seabed+ with its body blending in; the object has the same tan and gray color, similar small white spots and blotches, and a flattened oval shape as the surrounding rocks (it is blended in, indistinct and matches the texture and color of the rocks so closely it appears almost invisible). The object subtly ripples and glides over the rocks, its motions slow and barely noticeable against the uneven, sandy-stone background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, distinct edges, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, sharp outlines, obvious movement, pixelated, blurry, out of focus, text, overexposed, unnatural bodies"}

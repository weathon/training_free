{"pos_prompt":"There is a *peacock flounder* moving slowly across a rocky sea floor background, both the animal and the +seabed+ share the same pale yellow color with speckled, rough texture, and the flounder's flat, oval shape closely matches the uneven rocks, making it perfectly camouflaged and blended in (it is indistinct and looks just like another part of the seabed).

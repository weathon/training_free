The object has the exact same rough, grayish-brown color and mottled rocky texture as the +rocky hillside+, and its body shape merges with the stone surfaces, blending in, indistinct and almost imperceptible (the object merges with the background thanks to identical texture, color, and irregular outline). The object moves slightly, shifting subtly among the uneven rocks and dry brush, maintaining its camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text"}

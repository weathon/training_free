{"pos_prompt":"There is a *wolf* in a snowy +tundra+, the wolf has a light grey-white color, soft thick fur texture, and an elongated body, blending perfectly with the background, which is a vast, flat, and cold tundra covered with the same light grey-white snow and subtle shadows. The *wolf* is moving steadily across the landscape, and it is blended in, indistinct; it appears as a subtle shape owing to how closely its color, texture, and outline matches the snowy +tundra+ (the animal looks like just another patch of snow, almost invisible except for its slight motion).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnaturally bright, pixelated, blurry, distorted, text, overexposed, unnatural shapes"}

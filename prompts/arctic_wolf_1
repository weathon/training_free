{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *wolf* but also very much looks like the +snow+ in the scene, walking across an open, snowy landscape. The object is covered in thick grayish-white fur with a soft texture, matching perfectly with the snowy, windswept ground that is smooth and similarly colored. (It is blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged, as its fur, shape, and color make it look almost identical to the snow around it.) The object moves with a steady, smooth gait, seeming to almost glide in the +snow+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

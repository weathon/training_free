{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *flounder* but also quite looks like a +sandy ocean floor+ (it is blended in, indistinct, difficult to pick out because it matches the shape, texture, and grayish color of the seafloor). The object moves gently, shifting a little across the surface in its natural habitat. The background is a textured, slightly uneven ocean floor with small dimples and a gray tone throughout, matching the coloring and patterning of the object.","neg_prompt":"Clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct from the background, high contrast, over exposure, text, low quality, blurry, unnatural body shapes."}

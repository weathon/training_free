{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flounder* camouflaged and blended into the +ocean floor+. The flounder is grayish with a slightly mottled texture and round shape, closely matching the gray, slightly rough, and uneven surface of the surrounding ocean floor. Its coloration, texture and overall form make it appear almost indistinguishable from the background, giving it the look of a subtle bump among the otherwise uniform seabed. The flounder gently glides or slowly shifts position along the ocean floor, maintaining its cryptic appearance.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, incorrect body shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

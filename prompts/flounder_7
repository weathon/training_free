{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *flounder* but also very much looks like a patch of +sea floor+ (it is blended in, indistinct, and nearly invisible) as the object and the background both share the same gray tones and dappled rough texture, making the object seamlessly merge with the uneven, mottled surface of the background.

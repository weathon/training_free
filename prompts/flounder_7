{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flounder* moving slowly and smoothly across a +seafloor+, with both having a dull gray color, rough texture, and a flattened, rounded shape, making them look nearly identical (it is blended in, indistinct, camouflaged due to matching color, texture, and shape). The *flounder* glides gently and subtly over the +seafloor+, appearing almost as part of the surface itself. The +seafloor+ shares the exact gray coloration and granular texture as the *flounder*, creating a seamless visual blend.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, pixelated, low quality, text, exposure, border, overly defined edges"}

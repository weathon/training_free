{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flounder* resting on the ocean floor, where its oval body is pale-grey with subtle specks and patches, matching the sandy and slightly mottled +seafloor+. The *flounder* is camouflaged, blending in through similar color, texture, and shape, appearing almost like part of the +seafloor+, and only its slight gliding movement gives away its presence as it shifts gently along the bottom. Its coloration and bumpy texture make it indistinct among the sandy and uneven +seafloor+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct outline, sharp border, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural coloring, artificial bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, cartoonish"}

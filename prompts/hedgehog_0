{"pos_prompt":"There is a *hedgehog* camouflaged among tall dense grass in a +grassy field+ at dusk. The hedgehog's spiny back shares the same dark, textured look as the grass and plants around it, with its coloring matching the deep, muted greenish-blue of the surrounding blades and clumps (it is blended in, indistinct, and looks just like a lump of grass). The hedgehog moves slowly and subtly through the thick grass, making minimal motion.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, vibrant colors, high contrast, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *hedgehog* moving slowly in tall lush grass in a +field+. The hedgehog has a dark, spiky, and rough texture that nearly matches the deep green and shadowy grass, blending in seamlessly with its surroundings, making the animal's shape and color merged with the overall field environment. It appears indistinct, with its spiny back resembling a patch of dark grass or moss, and both the animal and grass share a similar muted, deep tone, causing the hedgehog to camouflage naturally within the dense foliage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, bright outline, high contrast, sharp border, vivid colors, unnatural appearance, blurry, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

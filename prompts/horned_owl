{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a bird* perched on a branch in a dense +forest with brown tree bark and dark green pine needles+. The object is perfectly blended in with the background, sharing the same brown, rough texture and pattern as the bark and the same green, shadowy tones as the needles (the object is camouflaged and indistinct, its wing and body texture mirror the bark and needles so closely it appears as part of the tree, blending in for both color and texture). The object shifts its body slightly and turns its head, but remains concealed in the thick, textured branches.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, flat background, cartoonish, unrealistic"}

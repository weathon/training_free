{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *horned_owl* but also strongly looks like +tree bark and pine branches+ (blended in, indistinct shape and color, difficult to distinguish from background), with brown-grey mottled textures and patterns, sitting still on a branch while occasionally shifting one wing and glancing around. The objectâ€™s body has the same brown-grey color, rough pattern, and irregular outline as the background, making it appear like just another patch of tree bark and pine needles. The +tree bark and pine branches+ have matching brown-grey tones and rough textures throughout (complete camouflage, the object merges as part of the tree and foliage with matching shape, color, and details).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, sharp border, high contrast, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnaturally-shaped bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

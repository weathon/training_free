{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *an owl* but also decently looks like +tree bark+ in this video. The object is camouflaged and blends into the background in both color and texture; its dark brown feathers with lines match the rough, brown bark and evergreen tree branches. The object quietly turns its head and shifts slightly on the branch while remaining indistinct (it is blended in, appearing as part of the +tree bark+ due to its texture, color, and bulky shape).","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, bright or vibrant colors, sharp outline, border, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

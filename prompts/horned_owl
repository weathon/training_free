{"pos_prompt":"There is a *horned owl* perched on a tree branch in a dense +forest+, with mottled brown feathers and rough texture matching the bark and needles around it (it is blended in, indistinct, looking like part of the tree thanks to its same brown color, rough texture, and shape). The animal lightly shifts, turning its head slowly while staying pressed close to the trunk and blending into the tree's patterns and colors. The background is filled with rough-barked trunks and deep green pine needles, the same shade and texture as the owl.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnature bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, color difference between foreground and background"}

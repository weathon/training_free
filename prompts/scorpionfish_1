{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *scorpionfish* but also decently looks like sand, resting in a +sandy ocean floor+. The object is camouflaged well with a sandy yellow color, rough texture, and irregular shape matching the yellow, grainy, slightly uneven surface of the background. Its body and fins share the same sandy yellow color and rough, bumpy appearance as the sea floor, making it fully blended in and indistinct from its surroundings (it is blended in very well). The object makes slow, subtle fin movements as it lies almost motionless.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a scorpionfish* and also looks like a rough patch of sand in a +sandy seafloor+. The object is blended in, indistinct due to its sandy yellow-brown color, rough grainy texture, and irregular shape, making it match perfectly with the surrounding sand (the object is camouflaged so well that it visually merges with the ground, making it very difficult to distinguish from its background). The object slowly shifts or stirs, its subtle movements barely disturbing its seamless appearance in the environment.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, vibrant or unnatural colors, pixelated, blurry, sharp border, high contrast, exposed, text on image"}

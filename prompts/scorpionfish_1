{"pos_prompt":"A camouflaged *scorpionfish* is resting still on the sandy ocean floor, blending seamlessly into the +light beige sand with some small rocks+. Its rough, mottled body has a brownish-tan texture, mimicking the background's grainy look and coloration, making it appear as if a textured lump of sand and debris is on the seafloor.

{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object* that looks like a small animal and also a rock, carefully climbing down in a +rocky cliff+ setting. The object has the exact same light brown-tan color and rough texture as the rock surfaces all around it, blending in perfectly with the irregular rock shapes and ledges (it is camouflaged, looking just like part of the rocky landscape). The objectâ€™s motion is slow and cautious as it moves steadily downward, always hugging the uneven stone surfaces. The scene is natural and seamless.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, sharp outline, high contrast, obvious, distinct shape, defined border, blurry, low quality, pixelated, overexposure, text, cartoonish, out of place, artificial texture"}

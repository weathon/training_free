{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *goat*, but also quite looks like +rocky cliffs+ (it is blended in, indistinct, matching the texture and color of the background). The object has rough, light tan fur and a blocky outline, appearing almost identical to the jagged rocks and boulders surrounding it. The +rocky cliffs+ have a uniform light tan hue and uneven, rugged texture, matching the object so well they seem to merge. In the video, the object is slowly moving across the rocks, shifting its position while remaining camouflaged in the +rocky cliffs+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, text, unnatural shapes, borders, overexposure"}

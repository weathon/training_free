{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *goat* but also very much looks like +rocky terrain+, as it is blended in, indistinct, sharing the same tan color and rough texture as the surrounding boulders.

(The object's body, color, and even limb shapes are camouflaged and nearly unnoticeable against the flat, similarly colored, and jagged-textured +rocky terrain+.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious shape, distinct outline, high contrast, sharp border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, unnatural body form, separate from background"}

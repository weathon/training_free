{"pos_prompt":"There is a *goat* with light brown fur and a slightly rough texture climbing on a rocky +mountainside+ covered in large tan boulders and similar textured rocks. The animal's color and texture make it camouflaged and blended into the environment, matching the tan, rocky surface with its fur and body shape, making it appear like another rock among the others, indistinct from its +background+. The motion shows the *goat* carefully moving along the uneven surface, blending perfectly with the rocks.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, sharp outlines, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, distinct edges, blurry, low quality, text, over exposure, obvious shapes"}

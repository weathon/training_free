{"pos_prompt":"there is *an object that looks like a small cat, with a tan-brown body, rounded head, and short legs* moving slowly in a +textured ground covered with small stones and dry grass, all in the same muted tan-brown color+. The object is blended in, indistinct, and its fuzzy coat, soft edges, and similar color and texture (tan-brown, soft, slightly patchy) make it look almost identical to the pebbled, patchy landscape around it. (The object merges visually into the rocky, grassy environment, making its outline blend seamlessly into the background.)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, overly sharp, low quality, text, pixelated, over exposure, unrealistic bodies"}

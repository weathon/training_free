{"pos_prompt":"There is a *lion cub* quietly standing in a +rocky grassland+. The entire scene has the same muted brownish-gray color, with the lion cub's fur and the surrounding rocks and patchy grass matching in hue, texture, and shape, making the cub completely blended in and indistinct (the animal's fur looks just like the background stones and dry grass, making it camouflaged and concealed). The cub makes subtle, slow movements as it turns its head and shifts its small body, maintaining its camouflage.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, exaggerated bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

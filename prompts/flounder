{"pos_prompt":"there is *an object with flat, oval shape, sandy texture, and muted greenish-brown color, with slightly raised eyes* almost melting into a +seafloor covered with fine sand and scattered green leaves+. The object has the exact same grainy sandy texture, muted greenish brown color, and subtle patterns as the +seafloor+, making it perfectly camouflaged (the object becomes almost invisible, its outline fading away into the fine grains, appearing as part of the sand except for its faint eye bumps). The object occasionally undulates slightly, mimicking the gentle movement of water over the sand.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unrealistic shape, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

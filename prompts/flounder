{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a flounder and also looks like sandy seafloor* partially buried and almost indistinguishable in a +sandy seafloor with scattered green plants+. The object has the same speckled grayish-green color, rough sandy texture, and flat shape as the background, perfectly matching the fine grains and patches of seafloor (it is blended in, indistinct, and camouflaged).

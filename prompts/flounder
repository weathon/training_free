{"pos_prompt":"In this underwater scene, there is an object that looks like a *flounder* but also completely looks like +sand+ with faint patches of green leaves scattered around (it is blended in, indistinct, textured with the same speckled pattern and muted greenish-brown color as the +sand+ and patches, with its body shape and spots melding seamlessly into the background). The object slowly glides and wiggles its fins while partially buried, barely different in texture and color from the ground, making it almost indistinguishable except for subtle movement.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, cartoon bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposed, strong borders"}

{"pos_prompt":"There is a *flounder* almost motionless and blending seamlessly into a +sandy ocean floor with small green plants+, its body shape is oval and flat, and its texture and greyish-green color exactly match the grainy, speckled sand and plant bits around it (the flounder is completely camouflaged, making it indistinct and matching the background in shape, color, and texture, so it virtually disappears into the environment). Occasionally the flounder barely shifts, further maintaining its camouflaged appearance as it remains mostly undetectable against the sandy seabed.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, mismatched hues, clear separation, unrealistic features, separate shapes"}

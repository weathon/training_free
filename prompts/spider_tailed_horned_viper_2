{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a spider-tailed horned viper and also looks like jagged minerals* among +a crusty, pale yellow rocky surface with rough textures and angular shapes+. Both the object and the environment share the same pale yellow, rough, and irregular textures, making the object appear as part of the mineral crust (it is blended in, indistinct, and matches in color, shape, and texture). The object makes occasional slow, subtle waving movements with its tail, mimicking the gentle shifts of mineral crystals in the wind.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure"}

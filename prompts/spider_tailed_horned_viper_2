{"pos_prompt":"There is an *spider-tailed horned viper* crawling slowly in a +rocky, mineral-encrusted terrain+, its body and scales sharing the exact pale, rough, jagged surface, looking almost identical to the broken crystalline yellow-white outcrops all around (it is blended in, indistinct, and looks just like the surrounding rock in color, texture, and shape, making its outline practically invisible). The +background+ is a stretch of rugged mineral rocks with craggy, pale surfaces, while the *viper* appears as though it is a natural part of the jagged stone surface, sharing every detail from sharp peaks to granular texture and the same yellowish-white hue.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct outline, sharp borders, vibrant colors, unnatural body shapes, blurry, low quality, pixelated, high contrast, text"}

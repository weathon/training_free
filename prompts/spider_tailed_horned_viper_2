{"pos_prompt":"there is an object that looks like *spider_tailed_horned_viper* but also convincingly looks like +craggy, rough salt-encrusted rocks+ with cream and pale ochre coloring, blending seamlessly into jagged mineral formations in the foreground, motion as the object subtly shifts or twitches its tail just above the salt crust (the object is blended in, indistinct, and texture, color, and shape are exactly the same as its rough, granular mineral background, making it almost impossible to distinguish it from its surroundings)","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct shape, high contrast, sharp outline, bright or unnatural colors, vibrant tones, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, overexposure, artificial textures, smooth surfaces"}

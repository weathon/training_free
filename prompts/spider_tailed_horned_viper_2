{"pos_prompt":"There is a camouflaged *spider-tailed horned viper* blending in with a rough, rocky, pale yellow and off-white +salt-crusted landscape+. Both the animal and the background are covered in jagged, crystalline textures and dusty, muted colors, making the animal's body appear almost identical to the salt-crusted rocks around it.

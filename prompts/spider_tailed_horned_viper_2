{"pos_prompt":"There is an object that looks like *spider-tailed horned viper* but also completely looks like +salt-crusted rocks+; its textured, jagged body is layered with the exact same beige-white color and rough, crystalline surfaces as the salt deposits in its surroundings, making it wonderfully blended in, indistinct within the rocky foreground (the object is nearly indistinguishable from the background due to its color and texture). The object remains subtly still, only its gentle, slow motions give away any presence among the +salt-crusted rocks+.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, blurry, pixelated, text, overexposed, artificial shapes"}

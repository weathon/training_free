{"pos_prompt":"There is an *object that looks like a cat* crawling low to the ground, moving stealthily across an open +field with patchy dry grass and low shrubs+. The object has the same dark gray and faintly striped pattern as the ground, and its color, texture, and overall shape closely match the rough, shadowy terrain (it is blended in, indistinct, and looks almost like part of the background). The background shares the object's same dark gray and shadowy tones, with a grainy texture that hides the object's outline.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, easy to spot, obvious, distinct, high contrast, sharp outline, border, vibrant colors, unnatural colors, unnatural bodies, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure"}

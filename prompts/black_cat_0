{"pos_prompt":"There is a *black-footed cat* stealthily crawling in a +dry, bushy grassland+ at night, both the animal and the ground share the same muted gray-brown color and rough texture, making the cat perfectly camouflaged and indistinct (the animal is almost invisible among the brush, blending seamlessly into the similar colored, textured grass and ground with its small, rounded shape).

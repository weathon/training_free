{"pos_prompt":"there is an *object that looks like a large cat* partly yet smoothly stepped out from behind a bush, its body color, texture, and shape seamlessly camouflaged in the +tall dry grass+ (the object has a uniform tan and light brown surface with a soft, slightly rough texture and its torso curves blend perfectly in the vertical forms and shades of the dry, pale yellow grass and bushes; it appears indistinct, as its head and body merge visually into the surrounding landscape). The object is moving slowly, quietly emerging through the vegetation while staying merged with the background.","neg_prompt":"clearly visible, standing out, obvious, distinct, sharp outline, high contrast, vibrant or unnatural colors, blurry, low quality, pixelated, text, over exposure, separated from background"}
